    "# Attention & Multi-Head Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Transformer architecture, the attention mechanism is the core component that enables the model to process sequences without relying on recurrence or convolution. Self-attention allows each element of a sequence (like each word in a sentence) to consider and weigh all other elements in the sequence simultaneously when producing an output representation. For every word, the model computes a weighted sum of all other words' representations, where the attention weights reflect how relevant each word is to the current word being processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of attention in Transformers is to capture dependencies between words or elements, regardless of their distance in the sequence. Traditional models like RNNs or LSTMs struggled with long-range dependencies because information from distant positions had to pass through many steps, leading to degradation or loss of information. Self-attention overcomes this by enabling direct interaction between all pairs of elements, allowing the model to quickly learn relationships between distant and nearby tokens alike. This is especially powerful in tasks like language modeling, translation, and text summarization where context from the entire sequence is often necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes attention in Transformers particularly useful is not only its ability to capture global dependencies but also its computational efficiency and scalability. Since self-attention can be computed in parallel across all positions (unlike sequential RNNs), Transformers can take advantage of modern hardware (like GPUs and TPUs) to train on massive datasets much faster. Furthermore, mechanisms like *multi-head attention* &mdash; where multiple sets of attention computations run in parallel &mdash; allow the model to capture different types of relationships simultaneously, enriching its representational power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding attention in Transformers is crucial because it lies at the heart of nearly all state-of-the-art models in natural language processing and beyond. Models like BERT, GPT, T5, and even newer architectures in computer vision and audio processing all rely on variations of this mechanism. Grasping how self-attention works gives deep learning practitioners the ability to design, interpret, and improve models that are now central to modern AI applications."

Note that practical Transformer-based models typically rely on subword-based tokenizers (e.g., Byte-Pair Encoding, WordPiece).\n",

    "## Motivation & Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that words need to be encoded as vectors to serve as input for neural network architectures because neural networks are designed to process numerical data, not symbolic text. A word in its raw form &mdash; like *\"apple\"* or *\"computer\"* &mdash; is just a sequence of characters without any inherent numeric meaning that a machine can interpret mathematically. To make text data usable for computation, we must transform these words into a form that the network's matrix operations and optimization algorithms (like gradient descent) can work with. Vectors, which are arrays of numbers, provide this bridge between symbolic language and numerical computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although not crucial for our discussion here, recall that we favor word vectors (or word embeddings) that map words into a continuous vector space where similar words with similar meanings are mapped to similar vectors. These vector representations are crucial for neural networks to exploit similarities, analogies, as well as generalize patterns across language data. If the model understands that similar words have similar vectors, it can apply what it learned about one word to another related word, improving efficiency and performance in tasks like classification, translation, and question answering. Without this numerical structure, the network would have no way to infer that similar-sounding sentences or synonyms are related, leading to poor generalization and ineffective learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, mapping an individual word to its embedding vector has its limitations. In natural languages, the same word may have different meanings or different syntactic functions depending on the context, i.e., the phrase or sentence the word occurs in. For example, consider the following sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *<p style=\"font-size: 125%;\">A light wind will make the traffic light collapse and light up in flames</p>*\n",
    "\n",
    "Particularly with respect of the multiple occurrences of the word *\"light\"*, what are the issues that arise when encoding the same word with the same embedding vector:\n",
    "* All three occurrences of *\"light\"* represent a different syntactic function: first an adjective, then a noun, and lastly a verb. Representing all three occurrences with the same embedding vector would fail to capture these syntactic differences, and with that also the semantic differences.\n",
    "* Even with respect to a single syntactic function, the same word may have (very) different meanings. For example, a *traffic light* is arguably a very different thing compared to a *torch light* &mdash; or just the noun *\"light\"* in a sentence like *\"I saw the light at the end of the tunnel\"*. Again, using the embedding vector for each occurrences of *\"light\"* would limit a model's capacity to better capture the context-dependent semantics of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image below illustrates the this approach of encoding the same word with the same embedding vector; of course, all words in the sentence would be encoded as vector, but for clarity, we focus only on the vectors for the three occurrences of *\"light\"* in our example sentence."

    "**Side note:** At least in the Transformer architectures, the embedding vectors would strictly speaking not be exactly the same for the same words in a sentence. This is because *positional embedding vectors* are added to the word embeddings to inject information about the position or order of words in a sequence, since these models lack inherent sequence awareness. They enable the model to capture the relative or absolute position of words, which is crucial for understanding context and meaning in language. Without them, the model would treat input tokens as an unordered set. However, the components of the final embedding vectors that capture the semantic words (and not the position) are still the same for the same words.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what we want is that the embedding vectors of words depend on the context (e.g., the sentence or paragraph a word occurs in) as well as the word order (this is where the positional embeddings come in). Again, we can illustrate this goal using our example sentence where now each occurrence of \"light\" is associated with a different embedding vector."

    "There are different approaches towards contextualized word embeddings. One of the first for training such word embeddings was [**ELMo** (Embeddings from Language Models)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELMo) based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). More specifically, ELMo trains a bidirectional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network on a large corpus with a language modeling objective &mdash; meaning it learns to predict both forward and backward sequences of words. This bidirectionality allows ELMo to capture both past and future context for each word in a sentence. The resulting word representations from ELMo are a combination of the internal states from all layers of the bidirectional LSTM, weighted depending on the task at hand. Because these embeddings dynamically change based on surrounding words, they can better capture word sense disambiguation &mdash; for example, the word *\"light\"* will have different embeddings in the sentences *\"traffic light\"* and *\"candle light\"*.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since ELMo embeddings are RNN-based their training and effectiveness to generate good contextualized word embeddings are restricted due to inherent challenges associated with RNNs. Firstly, RNNs &mdash; including variants such as LSTMs and GRUs &mdash; process sequences sequentially. This sequential nature makes it difficult to parallelize computations, leading to slower training and inference times compared to models that process sequences more efficiently. And secondly, although ELMo captures contextual information bidirectionally, RNNs have difficulty modeling long-range dependencies effectively &mdash; information from distant words may degrade or be forgotten as the sequence progresses, limiting the quality of context representation for long sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing these two core issues was the main motivation behind the Transformer architecture, and the fundamental concept  facilitating the generation of contextualized word embeddings is **attention**. Later, we will cover in detail how attention calculates contextualized word embeddings in such a way that (a) the required computations can easily be parallelized and (b) the distances between words no longer matter. At the moment, on a very high level, attention &mdash; or **attention head** (common terminology in the transformer architecture) &mdash; isa network component that takes in a sequence of embedding vectors and returns a sequence of recalculated embedding vectors. The figure below illustrates this idea of an attention head:"

To capture different types of such relationships in parallel, the Transformer architecture employs more than one attention head in parallel for the same input sequence(s).

This allows the model to dynamically focus on relevant parts of a sequence. In self-attention, alignment aims to capture various types of relationships between words in a sequence. These relationships help the model build a rich, contextual understanding of language.

    "\n",
    "The alignment between two words are not calculated based on their initial embedding vectors (i.e., example tensor $E$, see above). This is because the same word can serve different purposes. Attention distinguishes three different embedding spaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Queries:** The query embedding space can be thought of as a learned \"search space\" that represents what each token is trying to find or focus on in the sequence. Each query is a vector that captures the current token's intent or contextual needs &mdash; it looks for the most relevant information among the other tokens. Intuitively, imagine you are reading a sentence and trying to resolve a pronoun like *\"she\"*. Your brain \"queries\" the context to find which previous noun \"she\" (most likely) refers to. The query embedding encodes this intent: *\"I'm looking for a noun with certain properties.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Keys:** The key embedding space the content or features each token offers to the rest of the sequence. While queries express what a token is looking for, keys act like \"descriptors\" or \"labels\" of each token that say, *\"this is what I contain\"*. During attention, the query from one token is compared to the keys of all other tokens to decide which ones are most relevant. Think of the key embedding as a kind of index that enables efficient look-up. If the query is a search request, the keys are like metadata tags attached to each item in a database. The attention mechanism scans these keys to find matches that are semantically or syntactically relevant. This setup allows each token to be evaluated as a potential source of information based on the nature of the query &mdash; enabling the model to dynamically gather the right context for each word it processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Values:** The value embedding space in the attention mechanism represents the actual information that will be aggregated and passed on to the next layer — it is what gets transferred once a query decides which keys (i.e., words/tokens) to focus on. While queries search for relevant information and keys help locate it, values hold the content that the model uses to update its understanding of the current token. Intuitively, you can think of values as the payload that each token carries &mdash; the meaning or features that will influence the current token's updated representation. For example, if a token like *\"she\"* attends to *\"Alice\"* with a high score, it is the value vector of *\"Alice\"* that gets blended into the new representation of *\"she\"*. This separation of *\"where to look\"* (keys) from *\"what to extract\"* (values) gives attention mechanisms the flexibility to selectively gather and integrate context across sequences."

    "Attention calculates the alignment between two words (i.e., their respecting embedding vectors) in terms of their similarity. Again, the intuition is that key vectors $\\mathbf{k}\\in \\mathbf{K}$, which are more similar to a given query vector $\\mathbf{q}\\in \\mathbf{Q}$, the more relevant $\\mathbf{k}$ is for $\\mathbf{q}$ and therefore the higher the alignment. While there are many ways to quantify the similarity between two vectors, attention relies on the dot product. The dot product between two vectors captures both their alignment and magnitude. Intuitively, when two vectors point in the same direction, their dot product is large and positive; when they point in opposite directions, it's negative; and when they are orthogonal (perpendicular), the dot product is zero. This is because the dot product combines the lengths (magnitudes) of the vectors with the cosine of the angle between them, emphasizing how \"aligned\" they are.\n",

    "### Multi-Head Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we only considered a single attention head, even if we used it for different purposes (self-attention and cross attention). However, the Transformer uses multiple attention heads to allow the model to focus on different types of relationships and patterns within the input sequence simultaneously. Each attention head operates independently, learning its own set of projections &mdash; that is the set of transformation matrices $\\mathbf{W}_q$, $\\mathbf{W}_k$, and $\\mathbf{W}_v$ &mdash; for the queries, keys, and values. This means that one head might learn to focus on short-range syntactic dependencies (like subject-verb agreement), while another might capture long-range semantic relationships (like a pronoun referring back to a noun several tokens earlier).\n",
    "\n",
    "By using multiple heads, the Transformer can capture richer and more diverse contextual information than a single attention mechanism would allow. After each head computes its attention output, the results are concatenated and linearly transformed, combining insights from all heads into a unified representation. This multi-headed approach helps the model learn more nuanced representations of the input, which is especially useful in tasks like translation, summarization, or question answering, where understanding multiple layers of meaning is critical. The figure below from the Transformer paper shows the concept of multi-head attention. In this figure, $h$ represents the number of attention heads."

    "### Masking\n",
    "\n",
    "We already briefly discussed that `Attention` class implementing the scaled dot-product attention is missing the so-called **masking** step. While not fundamental to the concept of attention, masking is often required when training Transformer-based models practice. In a nutshell, masking in the Transformer architecture serves to control which parts of the input sequence a word is allowed to attend to during the attention mechanism. It modifies the attention weights by setting certain positions to negative infinity, effectively nullifying their influence in the *softmax* computation &mdash; since $-\\infty$ becomes $0$ after *softmax*. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the model's structure and learning objectives. There are two main types of masking commonly used in Transformers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Padding Mask:** This type of mask ensures that the model does not attend to padding tokens, which are inserted to make all input sequences in a batch the same length. Since padding carries no meaningful information, attending to it would waste computation and could negatively impact model learning. Padding masks are typically used in both the encoder and decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Causal (or Look-Ahead) Mask:** This mask is used in the decoder during training to prevent a position from attending to future positions in the sequence. For example, when predicting the next word in a sentence, the model should not have access to words that come later in the sequence. The causal mask enforces this autoregressive property by masking out all future positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, masking ensures that the attention mechanism behaves appropriately depending on the context &mdash; whether that means ignoring irrelevant padding tokens or preserving the autoregressive nature of sequence generation. It's a subtle but critical detail that allows the Transformer to function correctly and efficiently across different tasks. Giving its importance, we therefore cover masking as its own topic in full detail."

    "The figure above makes it clear that apart from the multi-head attention layers, the Transformer architecture consists of several other crucial components that contribute to its performance and flexibility. To give a brief overview here, some of these important components include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Positional Encoding.** Since the Transformer does not inherently understand the order of tokens due to its non-recurrent architecture, positional encoding is introduced to inject information about the relative or absolute position of each token in the sequence. This is done by adding a positional vector to each token embedding. These vectors can be fixed (using sinusoidal functions) or learned during training. The inclusion of positional encoding ensures that the model can differentiate between sequences like *\"dog bites man\"* and *\"man bites dog\"*. It enables the attention mechanisms to take token positions into account when computing contextual relationships, preserving the sequential structure necessary for understanding natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Feedforward Neural Network (FFN).** Each layer in both the encoder and decoder contains a feedforward neural network that operates independently on each position in the sequence. This component typically consists of two linear transformations with a non-linear activation function in between. The first linear layer expands the dimensionality, while the second reduces it back to the original model size $d_{model}$. The FFN acts as a powerful local transformation, allowing the model to process and refine information for each token position without interference from others. This helps the model capture more abstract features that attention alone might not be able to represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Layer Normalization.** Layer normalization is applied within each sublayer of the Transformer (i.e., after the attention mechanism and the feedforward network). It normalizes the inputs across the feature dimension for each token, helping to stabilize and accelerate training by reducing internal covariate shift. This is especially important in deep architectures, where the distribution of inputs can change significantly from one layer to the next. By standardizing the scale and distribution of activations, layer normalization enables smoother gradient flow and often leads to faster convergence. It works in conjunction with residual connections to ensure that learning remains stable and that deep networks can be trained more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Residual Connections.** Residual (or skip) connections are used around each sublayer (attention and feedforward) to allow the model to retain the original input and add the transformation on top of it. This technique helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem and allows gradients to flow more easily through deeper networks. The idea behind residual connections is that it's easier to learn a small adjustment to the identity function than to learn the full transformation from scratch. This not only helps with optimization but also encourages feature reuse, improving model performance and convergence speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Encoder and Decoder Stacks.** The Transformer is structured around stacked layers of encoders and decoders. Each encoder layer includes a self-attention sublayer followed by a feedforward network, while each decoder layer includes an additional encoder-decoder attention sublayer that allows it to attend to encoder outputs. These stacks enable the model to build deep and complex representations of both input and output sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, while attention is at the heart of the Transformer architecture, it is a combination of multiple components and concepts that make Transformers show state-of-the-art performances for real-world tasks. These components and the overall Transformer architecture are covered in more detail in other notebooks."

    "### Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we provide basic implementations for the scaled dot-product attention, attention heads, as well as multi-head attention layers to make the operations underlying the attention mechanisms and extensions more tangible. However, all code examples focus on simplicity and readability without performance considerations. For example, notice that the `AttentionHead` class implements three linear layers (`nn.Linear`) representing the three projection matrices $W_q$, $W_k$, and $W_v$. In practice these there linear layers are often implemented using a single linear layer, say, $\\mathbf{W}_a$ (*\"a\"* for attention) with $\\mathbf{W}_a \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{model}\\times d_k}$. Using this approach, the query, key, and value vectors can then be retrieved by splitting the output tensor after the projection using $W_a$. This approach generally shows a better performance in terms of training and inference time. While the changes to the code are small, using three separate linear layers are more intuitive to comprehend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue in terms of performance is the quadratic runtime of the attention mechanisms. For example, in case of self-attention and assuming an input sequence of length $N$, we need to calculate $N^2$ attention scores and attention weights. While the input sequences for our toy example were very short (only 4 and 5 words), in practice, the input sequences can be very long, potentially containing many hundreds or thousands of words. This becomes a major bottleneck when dealing with long sequences, leading to high memory usage and slow computation, which limits the scalability of standard Transformers. To address this, different strategies to improve performance have been proposed, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sparse Attention:** Instead of attending to all tokens, the model attends only to a subset (e.g., local neighborhoods or pre-defined patterns). Examples include *Longformer*, *BigBird*, and *Sparse Transformers*, which reduces complexity by imposing sparse attention structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Low-Rank Approximations:** Techniques like *Linformer* and *Performer* approximate the full attention matrix using low-rank projections or kernel methods, reducing complexity to linear or near-linear time while preserving performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Memory Compression:** Models like *Reformer* use locality-sensitive hashing to group similar tokens and compute attention only within those groups, cutting down on redundant computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hierarchical or Chunking Approaches:** These divide long sequences into smaller segments (chunks) and process them individually before combining the outputs, sometimes using additional global tokens to retain context across chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "These strategies aim to make Transformers more scalable while maintaining or improving training and inference time, enabling their application to domains that require processing long sequences efficiently. On the other hand, such strategie may lead to some loss of information as part of the attention mechanism and may (slightly) degrade its effectiveness. However, minor degradation in effectiveness are often accepted in practice in exchange for noticeable improvements in efficiency, particularly very large models such as foundational Large Language Models (LLMs)."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up, attention is a mechanism that allows models to focus on the most relevant parts of an input sequence when generating an output. Instead of treating all input elements equally, attention assigns different weights to different parts, enabling the model to selectively process information based on its importance to the task at hand. This approach has revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), allowing for more effective handling of long-range dependencies within text sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-head attention extends the basic attention mechanism by running multiple attention operations, or *\"heads\"*, in parallel. Each head learns to focus on different aspects of the input, capturing diverse patterns and relationships. The outputs of all heads are then concatenated and linearly transformed, providing the model with a richer and more nuanced representation of the input. This diversity is crucial for capturing complex linguistic features such as syntax, semantics, and word order.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Transformer architecture, attention &mdash; specifically scaled dot-product attention and multi-head attention &mdash; is the core building block. Transformers forgo recurrence entirely and rely on self-attention mechanisms to process sequences in parallel. This design not only speeds up training but also improves the ability to model long-range dependencies more efficiently than earlier models like RNNs and LSTMs. Attention and multi-head attention are fundamental to the success of Transformers in a wide range of tasks. Their ability to dynamically prioritize relevant information has enabled unprecedented advances in performance and generalization across many domains."
