    "# Transformers &mdash; Basic Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer architecture, introduced in the groundbreaking paper [*\"Attention is all you Need\"*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) in 2017, marked a fundamental shift in the design of deep learning models for sequence data. Unlike traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that process input sequentially, Transformers use a fully attention-based mechanism that enables parallel processing of entire sequences. This architectural innovation eliminated the inherent limitations of RNNs, such as difficulty handling long-range dependencies and slower training times due to their sequential nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key characteristics that sets Transformers apart is the **attention mechanism**, which allows the model to dynamically weigh the relevance of different words in a sequence when generating representations. This enables the Transformer to capture global context effectively, regardless of the position of words in a sentence. In contrast, RNNs often struggle with maintaining context over long sequences due to vanishing gradients, and they typically require mechanisms like LSTM or GRU units to cope. Moreover, because Transformers do not rely on recurrence, they benefit greatly from GPU acceleration through parallelism, leading to more efficient training on large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers have quickly become the foundation for many state-of-the-art models in natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and even protein structure prediction. Models like BERT, GPT, T5, and Vision Transformers (ViTs) are all built on the Transformer architecture. Their success has revolutionized applications such as machine translation, text summarization, image classification, and code generation. The flexibility, scalability, and performance of Transformers have made them the go-to model for a wide range of tasks across AI and ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given their dominance and versatility, understanding Transformers is essential for anyone looking to work in modern AI and ML. As the field continues to evolve, more applications are adapting the Transformer framework, not only because of its superior accuracy but also due to its adaptability across different data modalities. Whether you are interested in building chatbots, recommendation systems, or autonomous agents, a solid grasp of Transformer principles will provide a crucial foundation."

The size of both batches is $32$ and the length of each embedding vector is $d_{model} = 512$. In the Transformer architecture, $d_{model}$ refers to the dimensionality of the input and output embeddings as well as the hidden representations throughout the model. It defines the size of the vectors used to represent each word (more precisely: each token) in the sequence, and it remains constant across all layers of the encoder and decoder. The relevance of $d_{model}$ will be properly explained when explaining the overall architecture. "

    "## The Transformer Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below is taken from original Transformer paper [*\"Attention is all you Need\"*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) and  shows the overall Transformer architecture. The (full) Transformer is an encoder-decoder architecture &mdash; although different models may use only the encoder or only the decoder, as we will discuss at the end. If we assume an English-to-German machine translation task, the encoder and decoder served the following main purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Encoder:** The encoder's purpose is to read and understand the input sentence in the source language and convert it into a rich, contextualized representation. It does this by processing the input tokens through multiple layers of **self-attention** and **feedforward networks**, allowing the model to capture relationships between words regardless of their positions in the sentence. This means each word's representation is informed not just by its local context but by the entire sentence, enabling the model to grasp the nuances of meaning and grammar. By the end of the encoder, the input sentence is transformed into a sequence of embeddings that encapsulate both the individual word meanings and their contextual relationships. These embeddings are then passed to the decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Decoder:** The transformer decoder generates the output &mdash; here: the translated sentence in the target language &mdash; one word at a time, using the contextual information encoded by the encoder. The decoder takes the encoder's output and combines it with the previously generated target word to predict the next word in the translation. Each decoder layer first uses self-attention to consider the previously generated words, then **cross-attention** to incorporate relevant information from the encoder's output, followed again by a feedforward network. This process enables the decoder to build a grammatically correct and semantically accurate translation, ensuring that the generated sentence not only reflects the original meaning but also conforms to the structure and vocabulary of the target language."

    "Attention is at the heart of the Transformer architecture because it enables models to dynamically focus on the most relevant parts of the input data when making predictions. Unlike traditional sequence models that process data step by step, the attention mechanism allows Transformers to weigh the importance of all input tokens simultaneously, regardless of their position. This ability to capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships between tokens is crucial for understanding complex structures in language and other data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea behind attention is that not all parts of an input are equally important for a given task. By computing attention scores, the Transformer determines which tokens contribute most to a given output, enabling more flexible and efficient learning. This mechanism not only boosts performance in tasks like machine translation and text summarization but also allows for massive parallelization, making training faster and more scalable compared to recurrent architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we motivate and introduce the concept of attention on a fairly high level, focusing on its intended purpose and output. To fully understand the inner workings of the attention algorithm, we recommend going through the notebook dedicated to attention in Transformers.

    "\n",
    "Neural networks can't work directly with **nominal or symbolic data** like raw text because they are designed to perform mathematical operations on numerical data. Textual data &mdash; such as words or tokens &mdash; are inherently symbolic and have no inherent numerical meaning or structure that a neural network can interpret or compute on. For example, the words *\"cat\"* and *\"dog\"* are just labels; without numerical encoding, a neural network has no way to compare them or recognize patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, symbolic data lacks the continuous, differentiable structure that neural networks require for training. Neural networks learn by adjusting weights through gradient descent, which relies on calculating gradients — a process that only makes sense for numerical inputs. By converting text into numerical vectors (like **embeddings**), we give the model inputs it can compute with, while also preserving useful information about word meaning and relationships. This transformation is essential for enabling learning and generalization from textual data."

   "source": [
    "As a consequence, basically neural network architectures that work with nominal or symbolic data have an **embedding layer** as their first layer. An embedding layer is a type of neural network layer that maps discrete input tokens, such as word indices, into continuous vectors of fixed size. It is essentially a learnable lookup table where each row corresponds to the embedding of a specific word or token in the vocabulary. When a token index is passed into the embedding layer, it returns the corresponding vector &mdash; a process similar to looking up a value in a dictionary based on a key.\n",
    "\n",
    "An embedding layer associates the same word or token to the same (learnable) embedding vector. In other words, independent of the context &mdash; such as the surrounding words or sentence(s) &mdash; the same words always map to the same vector. To see why this may cause problem when it comes to understanding natural language, consider the following example sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *<p style=\"font-size: 125%;\">A light wind will make the traffic light collapse and light up in flames</p>*\n",
    "\n",
    "Just by looking at the three occurrences of the word *\"light\"*, we can see the issue that arises when encoding the same word using the same embedding vector. For one, all three occurrences of *\"light\"* serve a different syntactic function: first an adjective, then a noun, and lastly a verb. But even even with respect to the same syntactic function, the same word may have (very) different meanings. For example, a *traffic light* is arguably a very different thing compared to a *torch light* &mdash; or just the noun *\"light\"* in a sentence like *\"I saw the light at the end of the tunnel\"*. In short, using the same embedding vector for *\"light\"* fails to capture the word's syntactic function and proper meaning. This is where attention comes in."

In very simple terms, the attention head computes the alignment between each word and all other words in the same or a different sequence (incl. the word itself). This **alignment** between embedding vectors is calculated based on the **dot product**. These alignments are then used to recompute the embedding vector of a word as the weighted sum of all other word embedding vectors &mdash; where the weights derive from the strength of the alignments. Regarding the context that is used to calculated the alignment between words, there are two main variants:\n",

For example, given our sentence *\"A light wind will make the traffic light collapse and light up in flames\"*, self-attention computes the alignments between all pairs of embedding vectors. Both the encoder and decoder rely on self-attention to contextualize their input embedding vectors.\n",

By using multiple attention heads, the Transformer essentially gains multiple \"perspectives\" on the input. Each head operates independently, allowing different heads to focus on different aspects of the input. For example, one head might learn to identify syntactic dependencies (e.g., subject-verb relationships), another might focus on semantic relationships (e.g., recognizing synonyms or antonyms), and yet another might identify co-reference.\n",

The figure below illustrates the combination of multiple attention heads (here: $n_{heads} = 3$) into a so-called **multi-head attention (MHA)** layer. Notice how the same input sequence is given to three independent attention heads and how their output is combined to the final sequence of contextualized embedding vectors."

The input to the FFN is the output of the preceding multi-head attention layer (or the encoder's output in the decoder's second attention layer). The first linear layer expands the dimensionality of the token representation, effectively projecting it into a higher-dimensional space where more intricate features can be extracted. The activation function then introduces non-linearity, enabling the network to learn complex patterns that cannot be captured by linear transformations alone. Finally, the second linear layer projects the representation back to its original dimensionality. Mathematically, we can define the FFN therefore as:"

    "Apart from the multi-head attention and feed-forward network layer, an encoder layer implements a series of additional concepts. We briefly outline these additional concepts below but omit a more detailed discussion here since they are not specific to the Transformer architecture; these concepts are common in many neural network architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Layer normalization:** Layer normalization is a technique used to stabilize and accelerate the training of neural networks by normalizing the inputs across the features of a single training example. It operates independently for each sample by computing the mean and variance of all features in a layer and using them to normalize the feature values. After normalization, the values are scaled and shifted using learned parameters, allowing the model to recover the original distribution if needed. The main purpose of layer normalization is to reduce internal covariate shift &mdash; the change in the distribution of inputs to a layer during training &mdash; which helps make the optimization process more stable and efficient. It is particularly useful in architectures like Transformers and recurrent neural networks, where batch sizes may vary or where dependencies exist within a single sequence rather than across batches. By ensuring consistent activation distributions, layer normalization improves convergence and performance in deep models.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Residual connections:** Residual connections, also known as skip connections, are a fundamental architectural component in deep neural networks, notably popularized by Residual Networks (ResNets), and have since become a foundational component in models like Transformers. They work by creating a \"shortcut\" path that bypasses one or more layers, directly adding the input of a layer (or a block of layers) to its output. Notice in the figure above the two connections that bypass the multi-head attention layer and the feed-forward network layer. The main purpose of residual connections is to address the vanishing gradient problem and help train deep networks more effectively. By providing a shortcut for gradients to flow backward through the network, residual connections make it easier to optimize very deep architectures. They also allow layers to focus on learning small refinements (residuals) rather than complete transformations, which often leads to faster convergence and better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dropout:** (not explicitly visualized in the figure above) Dropout is a regularization technique used in neural networks to prevent overfitting during training. It works by randomly \"dropping out\" (i.e., setting to zero) a fraction of the neurons in a layer during each forward pass. This means that during training, the network effectively samples from a larger ensemble of smaller networks, each with different architectures depending on which neurons are dropped at that moment. At test time, dropout is turned off, and all neurons are used, typically with their outputs scaled appropriately to maintain consistency. The main purpose of dropout is to improve the model’s generalization by reducing reliance on specific neurons or features. By forcing the network to learn redundant representations and preventing co-adaptation of neurons, dropout helps ensure that the model performs well not just on the training data, but also on unseen data. This makes it particularly effective in reducing overfitting, especially in deep or complex networks such as Transformers."

    "\n",
    "Unlike Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNS), the Transformerslacks any built-in notion of order. Its core component &mdash; multi-head attention &mdash; treats input words as a set rather than a sequence, meaning it processes them in parallel and without inherent sequence information. As a result, without an explicit method to encode word positions, the model would be unable to distinguish between different orderings of the same words, which is critical for understanding meaning in language and structure in other data types. Positional encodings solve this by injecting position-specific information into the input embeddings. This allows the Transformer word order, dependencies, and temporal patterns &mdash; all of which are essential for tasks like translation, text generation, and sequence modeling in general."

    "### Masking\n",
    "\n",
    "The general purpose of masking in a neural network is to control which parts of the input or intermediate representations are visible or relevant during computation. By selectively \"masking out\" certain values such as padding tokens or future tokens in sequence generation, see below, masking ensures that the model focuses only on meaningful or valid data. This helps maintain the integrity of learning, prevents the model from making incorrect associations, and supports tasks that require structured attention, such as handling variable-length sequences or enforcing causality in language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Padding Masking\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we assumed that all sequences in our example batches `SOURCE` and `TARGET` have the same length &mdash; for parallel processing and efficient use of GPU acceleration, it is essential to organize input data into fixed-size tensors! However, particularly in the case of text data, it is often very unlikely that all sequences have the same length. To handle sequences of different lengths efficiently in a single batch, shorter sequences are padded with a special word/token (e.g., *\"[PAD]\"*) to match the length of the longest sequence. Of course, *\"[PAD]\"* does not contain any meaning itself, and it should therefore not influence the training of a Transformer model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Padding masking is a technique used in the Transformer architecture to ensure that padding tokens do not interfere with the learning process. Since Transformers process sequences in parallel using attention mechanisms, they treat all tokens in the sequence equally unless explicitly told otherwise. Without padding masking, the model might attend to padding tokens (which contain no useful information), leading to misleading attention scores and degraded performance. Padding masking helps the Transformer ignore these tokens during attention calculations by assigning them a very low (negative infinity) attention score. This effectively prevents the model from attending to padded positions when computing contextual representations of meaningful tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Causal Masking\n",
    "\n",
    "The common purpose of the decoder in the Transformer architecture is to generate sequences, typically in a step-by-step, **autoregressive** manner. In the context of text generation, this auto-regressive nature means that each generated token is conditioned on all previously generated tokens, ensuring coherence and grammatical correctness in the output. However, during training, the whole target sequences are given to the decoder as input. Without any additional consideration, the decoder would learn to predict the next not only based on previous words but also based on subsequent (i.e., future) words. This would misalign with inferencing since during inference time only previously predicted words are available. This misalignment between training and inference would significantly degrade the model's prediction performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Causal masking, also known as **look-ahead masking**, is a technique used in the Transformer architecture to ensure that a model generating a sequence (like in language modeling or machine translation) does not \"see\" or use future tokens when predicting the current token. In simpler terms, it restricts the self-attention mechanism so that each position in the sequence can only attend to itself and the positions before it—not the ones ahead. This enforces a left-to-right (causal) structure, which is essential when the model is generating output token by token. In short, causal masking ensures the training process mimics the conditions of inference time, when the model generates outputs one step at a time."

However, depending on the exact tasks, some additional layers are required to convert the output that can be used for training and inference. For tasks such as predicting the next word for a text generation, this typically means to convert the output into probabilities. For training, these probabilities are then used to compute the loss to facilitate backpropagation and parameter updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows the part of the overall Transformer architecture that converts to decoder output in terms of contextualized word embedding vectors to output probabilities. Here, it only shows a single linear layer, but arbitrary subnetworks containing multiple layers are conceivable. For example, nothing is stopping you to feed the decoder output into an Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) &mdash; whether this is indeed meaningful may depend on the task and is not really the point here. The last layer is commonly the softmax to convert the vector values into probabilities."

    "The Transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern machine learning and AI due to its remarkable ability to model complex dependencies in data through its self-attention mechanism. Originally designed for natural language processing, its success in powering models like BERT, GPT, and T5 demonstrated unparalleled performance across a wide range of NLP tasks, including translation, summarization, and question answering. Its parallelizable design, which replaces recurrence with attention, enabled efficient training on large datasets, unlocking the potential of large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning.\n",

    "What truly sparked widespread interest is the **transformer's versatility and scalability**. Its architecture has proven to be highly adaptable across domains—from computer vision and speech to biology and robotics—by simply reinterpreting domain-specific inputs as sequences. Combined with the ability to scale to billions or even trillions of parameters, Transformers have set new benchmarks in AI capabilities, enabling breakthroughs in generative models, code completion, and multi-modal reasoning. This generality and empirical success have made Transformers a central focus of research and development, driving both academic innovation and industrial applications at an unprecedented pace.\n",

    "### Encoder vs. Decoder vs. Both\n",
    "\n",
    "The original Transformer was introduced as a encoder-decoder architecture for sequence-to-sequence tasks such as machine translation, summarization, or question-answering. However, other tasks utilize only encoder or only decoder. These are generally referred to as encoder-only and decoder-only architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encoder-Only Architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoder-only Transformer architectures are models that utilize only the encoder component of the original Transformer design, without the decoder. These architectures are designed to take in an input sequence, process it using multiple self-attention layers, and output a contextualized representation of each token in the sequence. Since they do not generate new sequences like a decoder would, they are typically used for tasks that involve understanding or classifying input data, rather than producing text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common use cases for encoder-only Transformers include text classification, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER), and semantic similarity tasks. A well-known example of an encoder-only Transformer is [**BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers**)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)), which uses a bidirectional attention mechanism to capture context from both left and right of a given token. This bidirectional understanding makes encoder-only models especially powerful for tasks that require a deep understanding of the entire input, such as question answering or extracting information from documents. Overall, encoder-only architectures are ideal for non-generative tasks where the goal is to interpret or analyze an input rather than generate a new sequence. Their ability to model complex relationships in input data with high accuracy has made them foundational in many natural language understanding (NLU) applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decoder-Only Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Decoder-only Transformer architectures use only the decoder of the original Transformer design, adapted to function without an encoder. These models generate sequences in an autoregressive manner, meaning they predict one token at a time based on all previously generated tokens. A key feature of decoder-only models is causal masking, which prevents the model from \"seeing\" future tokens during training or inference, ensuring that each token is predicted using only past context. Unlike encoder-decoder models that require separate input and output sequences, decoder-only models operate on a single sequence, typically beginning with a prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common use cases for decoder-only Transformers include language modeling, text generation, chatbots, story and code generation, and question answering. Well-known examples are OpenAI's [**GPT**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer) models (e.g., GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-4), which are pre-trained on large corpora of text and fine-tuned for tasks ranging from summarization to translation and dialogue. These models excel at generating coherent, contextually appropriate text and are the foundation for many large language models (LLMs) used in real-world applications today. Because they model the probability of text sequences from left to right, decoder-only Transformers are particularly effective in tasks where generation and creativity are central.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encoder-Decoder Architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoder-decoder Transformer architectures, also known as sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) Transformers, include both the encoder and decoder components of the original Transformer design. In this setup, the encoder processes the input sequence and generates a set of contextualized representations, which the decoder then uses &mdash; along with previously generated tokens—to produce the output sequence one token at a time. The decoder uses self-attention with causal masking to attend to its past outputs, and cross-attention to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence. This architecture is ideal for tasks that involve translating or transforming one sequence into another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common use cases for encoder-decoder Transformers include machine translation, text summarization, question answering, and image captioning—essentially, tasks where the model must fully understand an input sequence and generate a different, corresponding output. Models like [**T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T5_(language_model)) and [**BART (Bidirectional and Autoregressive Transformers)**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461) are popular encoder-decoder architectures. Compared to encoder-only models (which are best for understanding tasks like classification) and decoder-only models (which are best for generative tasks based on a prompt), encoder-decoder models are optimized for scenarios where input and output sequences are both essential and often differ in form or language."

    "Apart from missing components such as masking and positional encoding, our example implementation of the Transformer architecture is very basic focusing on simplicity and understanding. In practice, a more optimized implementation will show a much better training and inference performance. Thus, it is generally always recommended to use optimized and tested implementations provided by libraries, such as PyTorch or Tensorflow. For example, the PyTorch library offers the classes [`TransformerEncoder`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.TransformerEncoder.html), [`TransformerDecoder`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.TransformerDecoder.html), and [`Transformer`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Transformer.html) &mdash; in fact, even the classes for the individual encoder and decoder layers are made available.\n",

    "### Variants & Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we focused on the architecture is presented in the original Transformer paper [*\"Attention is all you Need\"*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). However, over the years, the Transformer architecture has become more of a family of architectures, with different architectures incorporating minor or major tweeks to the originally proposed architecture. Below, we outline some important aspects of the original Transformer that have been proposed. However, given the relevance of this architecture, this is an active field of research, and new tweaks continue to be introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Different Layers & Architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the original Transformer architecture was introduced, researchers have made numerous advances to its core components to improve efficiency, scalability, and performance across tasks and domains. One key area of innovation has been in the attention mechanism itself; see more details below. In the feed-forward network sublayers, researchers have experimented with **alternative activation functions** beyond the original ReLU or GELU. For example, **Swish**, **SiLU**, and **Gated Linear Units (GLU)** have shown improved expressiveness and gradient flow. Some architectures, like the **SwiGLU** activation used in [**PaLM**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaLM), combine activation and gating for better learning dynamics. These changes often lead to modest but consistent gains in model quality, especially in large-scale pretraining scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps one of the most impactful architectural advances is the introduction of [**Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_of_experts)** layers, where only a subset of expert subnetworks (or feed-forward layers) are activated per input. Used in models like [**GShard**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16668), [**Switch Transformer**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03961), and [**GPT-4**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4), this approach allows models to scale to **trillions of parameters** while keeping per-example computation relatively constant. MoE allows Transformers to balance capacity and efficiency by selectively routing input tokens to specialized expert layers, effectively increasing model expressiveness without a proportional increase in compute cost. Together, these innovations reflect an ongoing effort to make Transformers more powerful, efficient, and adaptable to a wider range of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multi-Head Attention Variants\n",
    "\n",
    "The multi-head attention mechanism has revolutionized sequence modeling by allowing the model to jointly attend to information to generate rich and nuanced contextual word embedding vectors. However, particularly from a computational perspective, multi-head attention also poses several challenges, particularly for large to extremely large Transformer-based models &mdash; most importantly:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Quadratic complexity:** The attention mechanism computes the alignment between all pairs of words in sequence (assuming self-attention). Thus, given a sequence of length $L$, this means that the number of required operations as well as the required memory is in $O(L^2)$. This is a non-trivial problem for applications where we have to deal with typically (very) long sequences (e.g., language modeling, summarization, machine translation).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Redundant computations:** The autoregressive decoder takes a current input sequence to predict the next word. The decoder then appends this newly predicted word to the input sequence, and then uses this news sequence as input to predict the next word. Again, since attention computes the alignment between all pairs of words &mdash; including \"old\" words in previous iterations &mdash; the multi-head attention layer will perform the many same computations in each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore different variants of the multi-head attention mechanisms have been introduced trying to address some of these issues; here is a brief overview to some of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### KV Caching\n",
    "KV caching (short for Key-Value caching) is an optimization technique used in the Transformer decoder, especially during inference or generation. It focuses on reusing previously computed information for each attention layer, instead of recalculating them at every time step. This is particularly relevant in autoregressive generation &mdash; like in GPT models &mdash; where words are generated one at a time, and each new word depends on the previously generated ones. Using KV caching, the model stores information computed at earlier steps and simply appends newly calculated information in each iteration of the output generation. This allows the attention mechanism to reuse the old context efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "KV caching is crucial for scaling large language models in production settings. It reduces memory bandwidth usage, speeds up generation (especially for long sequences), and makes real-time or low-latency applications &mdash; like chatbots, code completion, and text summarization &mdash; feasible. Without KV caching, autoregressive decoding would be prohibitively slow for large models and long outputs. This, in turn, would significantly hamper users' experience prompting these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Avoiding quadratic complexity\n",
    "Several strategies have been proposed that approximate or redesign the attention mechanism to reduce computations involved in the multi-head attention mechanism to typically linear or sub-quadratic complexity. One common strategy is **sparse attention**, where each word only attends to a subset of the input sequence instead of all words. Examples include [**Longformer**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150), [**BigBird**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14062), and [**Sparse Transformer**], which use patterns like local windows, strided attention, and global tokens. These reduce the number of attention computations per word, often bringing the overall complexity down to $O(n)$ or $O(n\\log{n})$. This works well for tasks where locality or structured sparsity aligns with the input (e.g., long documents or structured data).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another popular approach is low-rank or projected attention, exemplified by [**Linformer**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04768). Instead of computing the full attention matrix, the idea is to project the individual input matrices to a lower-dimensional representation along the sequence length dimension. This assumes that attention maps lie in a low-rank subspace, reducing complexity from $O(n2)$ to $O(n)$ while maintaining reasonable accuracy. This is especially useful when attention patterns are redundant or compressible.\n",
    "\n",
    "A third major category includes kernelized or linearized attention mechanisms, like [**Performer**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14794) and [**Linear Transformers**]. These reformulate attention using kernel approximations that allow computation in linear time with respect to sequence length. They bypass the explicit construction of the matrix containing all alignment scores by exploiting mathematical properties such as the associativity of matrix multiplication or the kernel trick. While these methods often work well for long-range dependencies, they sometimes suffer from reduced accuracy compared to full attention, especially on shorter or complex sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Latent multi-head attention (LMA), particularly as introduced in the [**DeepSeek-V2 paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04434) (and further explored in [**DeepSeek-V3**](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.19437v1)), addresses the memory bottleneck associated with the Key-Value (KV) cache in traditional multi-head attention. LMA tackles this by introducing a low-rank factorization or compression of input for the attention operations. To this end, it projects the input into a much lower-dimensional \"latent\" space. This compressed representation is what gets stored in the KV cache. LMA reduces the size of the KV cache and enables longer contexts. It also allows for a faster and more efficient inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these strategies provide a toolbox for scaling attention to longer contexts, enabling applications in document modeling, genomics, real-time processing, and more. Each approach trades off accuracy, hardware efficiency, and general applicability, so the right choice often depends on the use case.\n",

    "#### Positional Encoding Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "The original Transformer paper [*\"Attention is all you Need\"*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) proposed fixed and absolute positional encodings using sine and cosine function to instill positional information into the learning process. Since then, many alternative and improved strategies have been proposed to enhance flexibility, scalability, and task performance. Here are some popular categories and strategies that go beyond the basic sinusoidal approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Learned Positional Embeddings:** Instead of using fixed sine and cosine values, embedding vectors are learned for each position in the sequence during model training. Learnable positional encodings can be more expressive and better attempt to specific domains. However, these embeddings are limited to a fixed maximum position seen during training and are hard to generalize to longer sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Relative Positional Encodings:** Instead of encoding the absolution position of words, here the goal is to encode the distance between words. This is especially helpful in tasks like language modeling where relative position (e.g., nearby context) matters more than absolute position. They also better support longer sequences and better generalization. Since relative positional encodings consider the relationship words, they are typically integrated directly into the attention mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE):**  RoPE encodes positions by rotating the input vectors of the attention mechanism. This keeps the distance-preserving properties of sinusoidal encodings but also allows for extrapolation to unseen sequence lengths. As such, RoPE is well suited for infinite-length or streaming tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi):** This approach adds a linear bias to alignment scores based on distance between words, encouraging nearby words to have stronger influence. ALiBI is simple and memory-efficient, and also supports extrapolation to longer sequences without increasing parameter size. Another advantage is the ALiBI can be easily integrated into the standard attention mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that this list is not comprehensive, with other encoding strategies being also proposed."

    "### Beyond Text\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Transformer was initially designed for text, its core mechanism &mdash; learning dependencies between elements in a sequence—proved to be remarkably general. Researchers soon began adapting the architecture to other domains with sequential or structured data. In **computer vision**, the introduction of the **Vision Transformer (ViT)** demonstrated that Transformers could rival and even outperform convolutional neural networks (CNNs) when applied to image patches as sequences. This shift led to a wave of Transformer-based models in vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **audio and speech processing** domain, Transformers have been used for tasks like speech recognition, music generation, and audio event classification. Models such as **wav2vec** and **Speech-Transformer** exploit the attention mechanism’s ability to model temporal dependencies in audio sequences. Likewise, in **time-series forecasting**—including applications in finance, weather prediction, and healthcare—Transformers provide a powerful alternative to traditional statistical models by learning complex patterns over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers have also made significant inroads into **scientific domains**, such as **bioinformatics**, **chemistry**, and **physics**. For example, in protein structure prediction, models like **AlphaFold** use attention mechanisms to model interactions between amino acids. In drug discovery and molecular modeling, Transformers can process chemical sequences or graphs to predict molecular properties and interactions. Additionally, in **reinforcement learning** and **robotics**, Transformer-based architectures have been used to model trajectories, plan actions, and encode memory over long episodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The adaptability of the Transformer lies in its ability to model **sets, sequences, and structured relationships** across many types of data—not just language. This versatility, combined with scalable performance and increasing computational resources, has made the Transformer a **foundational architecture across machine learning disciplines**, far beyond its original NLP roots."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer architecture revolutionized the field of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). Unlike previous sequence models like RNNs or LSTMs, Transformers rely entirely on a mechanism called **attention** to process input sequences in parallel, rather than sequentially. This innovation not only improved training efficiency but also enabled models to capture long-range dependencies more effectively. The Transformer consists of an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder processes the input and the decoder generates the output. Both components are built from layers that include multi-head self-attention, feed-forward networks, residual connections, and layer normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key innovations of the Transformer is its **multi-head attention**, which allows the model to focus on different parts of a sequence simultaneously, learning a richer representation of the input. By stacking multiple encoder (or decoder) layers, the model can extract hierarchical features, building deep contextual understanding. This has made Transformers especially powerful for tasks like translation, summarization, question answering, and many others. The architecture also incorporates positional encoding to retain information about the order of tokens, since it does not process sequences in order by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "The impact of Transformers has extended far beyond NLP. They have become the foundation for large language models (LLMs) like BERT, GPT, T5, and many others, enabling breakthroughs in zero-shot learning, code generation, and even image and protein modeling. Transformer variants like Vision Transformers (ViTs) have also been successfully applied to computer vision tasks, challenging the dominance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Their scalability and parallelism make them ideal for training on large datasets and deploying in real-world AI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of their widespread use and transformative impact, having a strong understanding of the Transformer architecture is essential for modern AI practitioners and researchers. Understanding how Transformers work &mdash; especially components like attention mechanisms, encoder-decoder layers, and residual connections &mdash; helps in interpreting model behavior, debugging issues, customizing architectures, and innovating new applications. As AI continues to evolve, knowledge of Transformers serves as a foundational skill for engaging with cutting-edge technologies and shaping the future of intelligent systems."
