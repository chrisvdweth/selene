    "# Word & Text Embeddings &mdash; An Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Word and text embeddings are numerical vector representations of linguistic units such as words, sentences, or entire documents, that are designed to capture semantic and syntactic properties of language. Instead of treating words as discrete symbols (e.g., IDs or one-hot vectors), embeddings map them into a continuous vector space where similar words or texts are located close to one another. This geometric structure allows models to reason about meaning using simple mathematical operations such as dot products or cosine similarity. In practice, embeddings form the backbone of most modern NLP systems, enabling tasks such as information retrieval, text classification, sentiment analysis, question answering, and recommendation systems to operate effectively and at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "The practical importance of embeddings stems from their ability to generalize beyond exact word matches. Because embeddings encode semantic similarity, models can recognize that words like *\"car\"* and *\"automobile\"* or texts discussing the same topic are related, even if they do not share identical tokens. This greatly improves robustness to vocabulary variation, synonymy, and noise. Moreover, embeddings provide a compact and dense representation of language, reducing the dimensionality and sparsity issues associated with traditional representations such as one-hot encoding or Bag-of-Words, and making them well-suited as inputs to neural network-based models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we first motivate the importance and relevance of word and text embeddings, as well as the core linguistic idea behind most approaches to automatically generate or learn good embeddings: the **Distributional Hypothesis**. The main part of the notebooks then provides an overview to various foundational and popular word and text embedding methods in a systematic manner by organizing the overview along fundamental characteristics of embedding methods. The main learning outcomes are understanding the challenges when working with textual data and machine learning algorithms (particularly neural networks), as well as understanding and comparing different embedding strategies on a high level. Let's get started."

    "### Why do we Need (Good) Embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "Textual data is considered *unstructured* because, it does not follow a predefined format that explicitly encodes meaning. Natural language is highly variable: the same idea can be expressed in many different ways, words are ambiguous and context-dependent, and structure such as syntax or semantics is implicit rather than explicitly labeled. The inherent complexity of language is a key reason why neural network models have become the dominant approach for solving NLP and related tasks. Traditional rule-based or linear models struggle to capture these nonlinear and hierarchical patterns, as linguistic phenomena often depend on subtle interactions between words, syntax, and broader context. Neural networks, in contrast, can learn rich, high-dimensional representations directly from data and model complex relationships through layered transformations and distributed representations. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, when it comes to using neural networks for NLP and related tasks, text is in fact a rather \"inconvenient\" for of data to work with, for the following to main reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Variable sequences vs. fixed-sized inputs:** Text, generally speaking, can be considered as a sequence of words (more generally: tokens) of variable length. Neural network models, on the other hand, assume standardized or canonical inputs, which typically entails inputs of a fixed size. Even sequence models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that can handle sequences of variable lengths, still require that the input at each time step is if a fixed size &mdash; of course, also words are just sequences of letters of variable size.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Nominal/symbolic data vs. numerical inputs:** From a data perspective, words/tokens are just nominal or symbolic data, i.e., data that consists of discrete labels or categories without any inherent numerical meaning or ordering. That fact the words such as *\"cat\"* and *\"kitty\"* might be similar because words are labels for real-world concepts, and these concepts are similar in our mental model of the world. To a machine, *\"cat\"* and *\"kitty\"* are completely different strings. In contrast, neural network models fundamentally rely on numerical input because their learning and inference processes are defined by mathematical operations such as matrix multiplications, additions, nonlinear transformations, and optimization via gradient-based methods. These computations require inputs to lie in a continuous or at least ordered numerical space where notions like magnitude, similarity, scaling, and distance are well defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "The illustration below summarizes these challenges. Presumably, if you would hear or read the sentence *\"I saw a cat\"* or *\"I saw a kitty\"*, you picture more or less the same situation since a *\"kitty\"* is commonly used to refer to a small/young cat. When we hear or read a word, we typically do not process it as an abstract symbol in isolation but instead associate it with a mental representation of the real-world concept it refers to. This can include visual imagery, sensory impressions, experiences, or related ideas that have been learned through interaction with the world. Such mental associations allow us to grasp meaning quickly, reason about context, and connect language to prior knowledge, which is why words can evoke rich and nuanced understanding far beyond their written or spoken form alone. In short, to us, the two words and therefore the two sentences are similar."

To illustrate this problem let's assume we represent each word using vectors containing the ASCII codes of the words in the letter and pad each vector to the longest word (e.g., $10$).

    "In principle, each word can now be converted into a fixed-sized numerical representation and indeed be passed to a neural network as a valid input. However, ASCII codes are arbitrary numerical assignments designed for text storage and transmission, not for expressing linguistic relationships. As a result, the numerical distance between character codes or between entire character sequences has no meaningful interpretation: words that are semantically related (e.g., *\"cat\"* and *\"dog\"*) may be far apart in ASCII space, while unrelated words may appear artificially close due to shared characters or similar lengths. For example, the word *\"hat\"* would have the vector representation $[104, 97, 116, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$ and therefore be much close to *\"cat\"* than *\"kitty\"*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For neural network-based models, this is a serious limitation because effective learning relies on meaningful notions of similarity and smoothness in the input space. Neural models assume that small changes in input values should correspond to small, interpretable changes in meaning, enabling generalization across related inputs. ASCII-based representations violate this assumption, as they encode surface form rather than conceptual content and fail to reflect semantic or syntactic relatedness between words. Consequently, such representations make it difficult for neural networks to learn patterns about meaning, motivating the use of distributed word representations (embeddings) that place related words close to each other in a learned numerical space."

    "### How Can We Find Good Embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "The core motivation behind word embeddings is to represent words as vectors in a continuous space where each dimension can be interpreted as capturing **some latent property or feature** that is shared across words. Instead of treating words as isolated symbols, this representation assumes that meaning can be decomposed into multiple underlying factors (e.g., syntactic role, semantic category, or contextual usage) that jointly characterize how words behave in language. By encoding these factors as numerical dimensions, words that share similar properties naturally end up with similar vector representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this intuition, let's assume we want to find good embedding vectors for animals. In this limited scope, we may come up with the two latent properties or features of an animal being *furry* and *dangerous* &mdash; of course, the are many more such features (e.g., size, diet, locomotion), but two features is easy to plot &mdash; and we express the level of furriness and dangerousness as a values between $0$ and $1$. The table below shows the values for some selected animals; the values are kind of arbitrary and only for illustration purposes."

This structure allows neural models to generalize across vocabulary items, transfer learned patterns from frequent to rare words, and reason about relationships through simple geometric operations.

    "\n",
    "The central role of word and text embeddings in modern NLP has driven the development of a wide variety of representation methods, reflecting the many ways in which linguistic information can be encoded and used. At a high level, these methods can be organized by granularity, distinguishing **word embeddings**, which represent individual tokens in isolation or context, from **text embeddings**, which aim to capture the meaning of larger units such as sentences, paragraphs, or entire documents. Another key distinction is between **sparse and dense embeddings**: sparse representations encode text using high-dimensional, interpretable features tied to explicit vocabulary items, whereas dense embeddings compress meaning into low-dimensional, continuous vectors that better capture semantic similarity. Finally, embeddings can be **static or contextual**. Static embeddings assign a single vector to each word or text regardless of usage, while contextual embeddings adapt representations dynamically based on surrounding context, allowing them to model polysemy and nuanced meaning."

    "#### Granularity: Word vs. Text Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "On the most basic level, an embedding vector may represent an individual word or a whole text (e.g., a sentence, a paragraph or a (short) document). **Word embeddings** capture the meaning of individual words, encoding semantic and syntactic relationships between them. These are useful for tasks where understanding the relationships between words themselves is important, such as word similarity, analogy reasoning, or basic text classification. In contrast, **text embeddings** aggregate information across multiple words to capture the overall meaning, topic, or sentiment of a text rather than focusing on individual word semantics. This higher-level representation is particularly valuable for tasks like semantic search, document clustering, or summarization, where understanding the broader context and meaning of a piece of text is more important than individual word-level relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Subword-based methods have become extremely common in modern NLP because they address several limitations of word-level embeddings, particularly the handling of rare or out-of-vocabulary words. Instead of representing words as atomic units, subword methods break words into smaller components &mdash; such as character n-grams, morphemes, or byte-pair encodings &mdash; and learn embeddings for these subunits. This allows models to compose representations for words that were never seen during training by combining the embeddings of their subwords, improving robustness and coverage across diverse vocabularies and languages with rich morphology. With respect to vector representations, subword embeddings are typically **combined or aggregated** to form a final word or text vector. This approach strikes a balance between granular representation, memory efficiency, and the ability to generalize to unseen or rare words."

    "#### Sparsity: Sparse vs Dense Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedding vector word and text embeddings can be broadly distinguished into **sparse** and **dense** representations because they embody two fundamentally different ways of encoding linguistic information. On a superficial level, this refers to how the embedding vectors \"look\" in terms of their size as well as the nature of their values. However, the distinction between dense and sparse vectors have more fundamental effects on their expressiveness when encoding words or text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sparse embeddings** are high-dimensional (often tens of thousands of dimensions or more) vectors with most elements being $0$. Each dimension usually corresponds to an explicit feature, most commonly to specific word (or token) &mdash; in which case the size of the embedding vectors reflects the size of the vocabulary, i.e., the set of unique words/tokens. This sparse structure (high-dimensional + mostly zero values) offer several important advantages, especially in information retrieval and classical NLP settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Interpretability and transparency:** Each dimension typically corresponds to an explicit, human-understandable feature (e.g., a word or term). This makes it easy to inspect why two texts are considered similar or why a document was retrieved. Sparse embeddings also allow to explicitly control which terms or features are represented (e.g., through stop-word removal or domain-specific vocabularies), which is valuable in specialized or regulated domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Exact matching and high precision:** Sparse embeddings excel at capturing exact lexical overlap. For example, if a query and document share important terms, sparse representations strongly reflect this, which is crucial for keyword search and precision-oriented tasks. For example, in domains with specific terminologies (e.g., legal, medical, or regulatory texts) it is often crucial that certain words or terms match exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Efficient and stable retrieval:** Sparse embeddings integrate naturally with inverted indexes, enabling efficient storage and fast large-scale retrieval, while their deterministic construction ensures stable, reproducible representations without sensitivity to random initialization or training instability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, sparse embedding vectors also come with clear limitations, especially when semantic understanding and robustness are required:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Limited semantic expressiveness and generalization:** Sparse embeddings depend on lexical overlap and primarily encode surface-level features, making them ineffective at capturing synonymy, paraphrases, and deeper linguistic structure. For example, sparse embeddings may fail or struggle to capture the semantic similarities between words  (e.g., *\"car\"* vs. *\"automobile\"*), leading to low recall in semantic tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Brittleness to vocabulary variation:** Differences in wording, typos, morphological variants, or unseen terms can significantly degrade performance without extensive preprocessing or manual normalization. In practice, this means that strong performance often requires careful, domain-specific preprocessing and weighting schemes, increasing system complexity and maintenance effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **High dimensionality and poor suitability for semantic tasks:** Vocabulary-sized representations are conceptually and computationally unwieldy and perform poorly for similarity-based tasks such as semantic search, clustering, and recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, dense embedding vectors are more commonly used because they capture semantic relationships between words and texts in a continuous, low-dimensional space. By encoding meaning through distributed representations, dense embeddings can recognize similarity even when there is little or no exact word overlap, allowing models to understand that *\"car\"* and *\"automobile\"* or *\"buy\"* and *\"purchase\"* are closely related. This ability to generalize beyond surface-level lexical matching makes dense embeddings especially effective for tasks such as semantic search, clustering, recommendation, and downstream neural NLP models, where robustness to paraphrasing and vocabulary variation is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, sparse embeddings remain widely used in settings where high precision, transparency, and controllability are critical. Because each dimension in a sparse representation typically corresponds to an explicit term or feature, it is straightforward to interpret why two documents are considered similar or why a particular result was retrieved. This explainability, combined with strong performance for exact or near-exact matching, makes sparse methods attractive for legal, biomedical, and enterprise search, as well as for compliance-sensitive applications. As a result, rather than being replaced, sparse embeddings often coexist with dense ones, sometimes even combined in hybrid retrieval systems, to balance semantic recall with precision and interpretability."

    "#### Context Sensitivity: Static vs. Contextual Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Static embeddings.** A word or text embedding is considered static if the vector representation of the same word or the same text is the same. For example, in case of a word embedding, *\"bank\"* will have the same vector representation independently if it is referring to the financial institute or the side of a river in the context of a sentence. Since static embeddings are always the same for the same input (word or text) they can be precomputed and easily shared. This is several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Efficiency and simplicity**: Static embeddings are fast at inference, inexpensive to train, and easy to integrate into downstream models using simple lookup operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Low overhead and scalability**: They require less memory and computational resources, making them well suited for large-scale or resource-constrained deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stability and sufficient performance**: Their fixed representations are deterministic, easier to debug, and often perform well for tasks where fine-grained contextual meaning is not essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as the *\"bank\"* example already illustrates, static embeddings are limited by their **lack of context awareness**, as each word or text unit is assigned a single fixed vector that cannot capture multiple meanings or adapt to different usages. This restricts their ability to model fine-grained semantic and syntactic nuances and leads to weaker performance on tasks requiring deep contextual understanding. In addition, static embeddings handle rare or unseen words poorly and are often sensitive to domain shifts, since their representations are tightly coupled to the data on which they were trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contextual embeddings.** In contrast to static embeddings, contextual embeddings do generally not assign the same vector representation to a word or text but generate representations dynamically based on the surrounding context, allowing the same word to have different vectors depending on its usage and meaning in a specific sentence or document. In practice, this has several common advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Context-aware representations**: Contextual embeddings adapt word or text representations to their surrounding context, effectively handling ambiguity and polysemy (e.g., *\"bank\"* will result in different vector representations depending on its use/meaning in a sentence).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Richer linguistic information**: They capture fine-grained semantic and syntactic relationships by modeling interactions between words in a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Improved task performance and robustness**: Contextual embeddings generally achieve better results on complex NLP tasks and generalize more well across paraphrases and domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the flip side, contextual embeddings require substantial computational and memory resources because each input must be processed, often through large neural models, which makes both training and inference more expensive and slower compared to static embeddings. This can be a limitation for large-scale or real-time applications, where efficiency is critical. They also introduce engineering challenges such as model versioning, dependency management, and sensitivity to input formulation, where minor changes in wording or punctuation can significantly alter the embeddings. Despite these limitations, their ability to capture nuanced context and improve task performance often outweighs these costs in many modern NLP applications."

    "#### Other Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from granularity (word vs. text), sparsity (sparse vs. dense), and context sensitivity (static vs. contextual), embeddings can be categorized along several other dimensions that reflect how they are trained and used. One common distinction is **training objective**, which separates embeddings based on whether they are learned through predictive models (e.g., Word2Vec, FastText) that aim to predict surrounding words, or through count-based/statistical methods (e.g., PPMI, LSA) that factorize co-occurrence matrices. Another approach is **supervision level**, where embeddings may be unsupervised (learned purely from raw text), semi-supervised (leveraging limited labeled data), or task-specific/fine-tuned (adapted to a downstream NLP task). Embeddings can also be categorized by **modality or input type**. While most embeddings are textual, cross-modal embeddings exist that integrate text with other data types, such as images, audio, or structured knowledge graphs, enabling richer multi-modal representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we limit ourselves to textual inputs (word or text) and organize our overview according to the main three dimensions: granularity, sparsity, and context sensitivity. We mention the training objective, supervision level, and other characteristics when discussing the individual embedding methods in more detail."

    "## Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings are a central concept in natural language processing because words form the fundamental building blocks of language. Meaning at the level of sentences, paragraphs, or entire documents ultimately emerges from the meanings and interactions of individual words. By assigning each word a numerical representation, word embeddings provide the basic units from which higher-level text representations can be constructed, whether by aggregation, sequence modeling, or more complex neural architectures. High-quality word embeddings therefore have a direct impact on the performance of almost all downstream NLP tasks, as they shape how models perceive and reason about language from the ground up.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the term *\"word\"* is often used as a simplification. Many modern embedding methods do not operate strictly on full words, but on **tokens**, which may correspond to subwords, character n-grams, or other units derived from tokenization schemes such as Byte Pair Encoding or WordPiece. These subword-based representations help address issues like rare words, morphological variation, and out-of-vocabulary terms. For conceptual clarity, however, it is common to refer to all these units collectively as \"words\", with the understanding that the underlying models may actually embed smaller or more flexible linguistic units. Thus, in the following, if not stated otherwise, we use the terms *\"words\"*, *\"subwords\"*, and *\"tokens\"* as synonyms."

    "##### Converting Sparse to Dense Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "One general and common way to create static dense embedding vectors is to convert static sparse embedding vectors by apply **linear dimensionality reduction** to a co-occurrence matrix. The most widely used strategy is [Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition), where the matrix is factorized and only the top-$k$ singular components are retained. This produces low-dimensional dense vectors that capture the dominant co-occurrence patterns in the data, as in [Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis). Closely related approaches include [truncated SVD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition) and [Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis), which similarly project high-dimensional sparse vectors into a compact continuous space while preserving as much variance or structure as possible. Beyond linear methods, **non-linear dimensionality reduction** techniques such as [autoencoders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder) or neural factorization models can also be used to learn dense representations, although classical linear methods remain popular due to their simplicity, interpretability, and strong connection to distributional semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "These dimensionality reduction methods for obtaining dense embeddings have several structural limitations compared to predictive embedding models like Word2Vec, GloVe, or fastText (discussed below). Most importantly, they rely on global matrix construction and factorization, which is **memory-intensive and computationally expensive** for large vocabularies and corpora. This makes them difficult to scale and update incrementally when new data arrives. In addition, these methods typically depend on fixed co-occurrence statistics and linear projections, which limits their ability to model more complex, non-linear semantic relationships present in language. Furthermore, embeddings derived via dimensionality reduction are usually **static and word-level only**, assigning a single vector per word and offering no built-in mechanism for handling rare or unseen words. As a result, while dimensionality reduction techniques are conceptually elegant and historically important, they are generally less flexible and less expressive than modern embedding approaches.\n"

    "##### Word2Vec\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec, introduced by Mikolov et al. (2013), is a family of neural embedding models that learn dense, low-dimensional vector representations of words from large text corpora by exploiting their surrounding contexts. By capturing distributional patterns of word co-occurrence, Word2Vec embeddings encode semantic and syntactic relationships, enabling words with similar meanings to be close to each other in vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its core, Word2Vec is implemented as a word classification task where the goal is to train a model that can predict word relationships based on their contexts. The figure below illustrates the general architecture assuming a single word as input and a single word as output. The Word2Vec model can be implemented as a shallow neural network contain one hidden layer &mdash; represented by input weight matrix $\\mathbf{U}$ &mdash; and one output layer &mdash; represented by input weight matrix $\\mathbf{V}$ &mdash; This classification setup is essential because it enables Word2Vec to learn **semantic word embeddings** indirectly through prediction. By training to correctly classify words in context, the model adjusts its internal word vectors, captured by $\\mathbf{U}$ and $\\mathbf{V}$ so that words appearing in similar contexts have similar representations. Thus, while Word2Vec’s ultimate goal is not classification per se, framing it as such provides a simple and effective learning objective for capturing the statistical structure of language.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are different model implementations of Word2Vec typically focusing on improving efficiency, the two fundamental architectures of Word2Vec are **Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW)** and **Skip-gram**. The CBOW model takes as input a set of context words (typically words within a fixed window around the target) and aims to predict the center word. The \"bag-of-words\" term refers to the fact that the order of context words is ignored; only their presence matters. For example, in the sentence *\"we were watching funny movies on netflix last weekend\"*, if the window size is 2 and the target word is *\"movies\"*, the context words would be *\"watching\"*, *\"funny\"*, *\"on\"*, and *\"netflix\"* (again, CBOW ignores the actual order). For this example, the training sample might look as follows — keep in mind that the order of the context words does not matter, even when shown as a list here:"

    "Both CBOW and Skip-gram have the same underlying training objective. If $\\mathbf{v}_i \\in \\mathbf{V}$ denotes the input embedding vector for a word $w_i$, and $\\mathbf{u}_j \\in \\mathbf{U}$ the output embedding vector of a word $w_j$, both models try to minimize the dot product $\\mathbf{u}_{j}^\\top \\mathbf{v}_i$. Intuitively, this means that the embedding vectors of center words and context words become more and more similar during the training of both models. Notice that this is not really what we are looking for. For example, we are not directly interested in the case where the embedding vectors for the words *\"movie\"* and *\"funny\"* are similar. However, this *explicit* training objective *implies* that (center) words that often appear in very similar contexts will also have similar embedding vectors. To see, this consider the phrase *\"watching funny videos on YouTube\"*, with *\"videos\"* being the center words. Since (a) the words *\"movies\"* and *\"videos\"* often appear in (very) similar contexts, and (b) both their embedding vectors will be similar to embedding vectors of those shared context words, the embedding vectors for *\"movies\"* and *\"videos\"* will also be similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in both CBOW and Skip-gram, each word is associated with two distinct vector representations: an input embedding in $\\mathbf{V}$ and an output (target) embedding in $\\mathbf{U}$. As a result, the models learn two embedding matrices, reflecting the asymmetric roles words play when they appear as predictors versus prediction targets. After training, several strategies exist to obtain a single embedding per word. The most common approach is to discard the output embeddings and keep only the input embeddings, which empirically work well for many downstream tasks. Alternatively, one can use only the output embeddings, or combine both vectors, for example by averaging or concatenating them, to capture information from both roles. In practice, the choice depends on the task, but using the input embeddings alone has become the de facto standard due to its simplicity and strong performance."

As a consequence, the probability $P_{paris,the}$ will also be high just like $P_{paris,france}$. However, *\"france\"* arguably carries much more semantic information about *\"paris\"* then *\"the\"*. To address this, GloVe considers the ratio $P_{ik}/P_{jk}$ to capture how strongly a context word $w_k$ is associated with word $w_i$ compared to word $w_j$.

    "##### fastText\n",
    "\n",
    "fastText, developed by Facebook,s AI Research (FAIR) lab, serves as an extension of the Word2Vec framework, specifically building upon the CBOW and Skip-gram architectures. While traditional Word2Vec models treat each word as an atomic, indivisible entity, fastText introduces a more granular approach by representing each word as a **bag of character n-grams**. By incorporating these **sub-word features**, fastText allows the model to capture the internal structure and morphology of words. This architectural shift provides two significant advantages over its predecessors: it can generate high-quality embeddings for rare words that appear infrequently in the training data, and it effectively solves the Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) problem. Even if a word was never seen during training, fastText can still construct a vector for it by summing the representations of its constituent n-grams, making it exceptionally robust for morphologically rich languages and datasets with frequent misspellings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the standard fastText implementation, only the input words (the words used as context in Skip-gram or the window words in CBOW) are split into n-grams. The output words (the target words being predicted) are typically treated as distinct, whole entities. The size of the n-grams is a hyperparameter. For example, with $n=3$ (i.e., $3$-grams), the word *\"netflix\"* would be decomposed into sub-word sequences like *\"&lt;ne\"*, *\"net\"*, *\"etf\"*, *\"tfl\"*, *\"fli\"*, *\"lix\"*, and *\"ix&gt;\"*. The angled brackets are important to indicate word boundaries, helping the model distinguish between subwords that appear at different positions. For example, the word *\"get\"* cannot be split into $3$-grams, but the model needs to able to distinguish the whole word from *\"get\"* being a $3$-gram in, say, *\"forgettable\"*. Apart from the n-grams, fastText still takes in each input word as a whole word as well. Thus, using $3$-gram, our CBOW training sample from above will look as follows for fastText:"

Of course, *\"youtube\"* will not have a corresponding entry in the input embedding matrix $\\mathbf{V}$ for the whole word. However, the assumption is that a majority of the, say, $3$-grams *\"&lt;yo\"*, *\"you\"*, *\"out\"*, *\"utu\"*, *\"tub\"*, *\"ube\"*, and *\"be&gt;\"* will be known, i.e., be in $\\mathbf{Z}$.\n",

    "Of course, unseen words might also result in unseen n-grams. However, fastText does *not* ignore new n-grams at inference time as this would throw away exactly the information fastText was designed to capture, i.e., subword structure. Instead, fastText uses **hashing** guarantees that every possible n-gram *always* maps to some embedding vector, even if that n-gram was never seen during training. More concretely, fastText does *not* maintain an explicit lookup table of known n-grams. Instead, it stores a fixed-size array of embedding vectors (hash buckets) that were trained using all n-grams encountered during training. When a new n-gram appears at inference time, the same hash function is applied, and the resulting index points to one of these already-trained buckets. That bucket's vector has been updated during training by other n-grams that happened to hash to it. Due to this parameter sharing, the new n-gram inherits a representation that reflects similar character patterns learned from the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ignoring unseen n-grams would lead to systematically weaker representations for unseen words, especially those composed of novel but informative character sequences. Hashing instead provides a smooth generalization mechanism: unseen n-grams are not treated as \"unknown\" but are mapped into the same embedding space as known ones, with collisions acting as a form of regularization. As long as the number of hash buckets is sufficiently large, collisions are sparse enough that this approximation works well in practice, allowing fastText to remain efficient while still producing meaningful embeddings for previously unseen words."

    "Using a bidirectional LSTM allows ELMo to construct word representations that depend on both left and right context, which is crucial for capturing how meaning varies with usage. Many words are ambiguous when viewed from only one direction (e.g., *\"bank\"*, *\"charge\"*), and relying solely on past context can be insufficient to disambiguate them. By combining a forward LSTM that summarizes preceding words with a backward LSTM that summarizes following words, ELMo produces embeddings that encode richer syntactic and semantic information, such as long-range dependencies, agreement, and phrase-level structure. This bidirectional context is especially beneficial for downstream tasks like named entity recognition or question answering, where cues often appear after the word being interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "This design is suitable for ELMo precisely because the model is **not intended to generate text**, but to serve as a feature extractor for contextual word embeddings. Unlike generative language models, which must respect causality and predict tokens sequentially, ELMo is applied to complete sentences that are fully observed. This allows it to \"peek\" at future words without violating any constraints.

During downstream training, gradients from the task loss (e.g., NER, QA, classification) update these scalars so the model learns which layers are most useful for that task. For example, syntactic tasks often place more weight on lower layers, while semantic tasks emphasize higher layers. Importantly, the ELMo language model parameters are usually frozen, so only the layer-mixing weights and the downstream model parameters are trained.

    "##### BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT is a widely used contextual embedding model that represents words as vectors conditioned on their full surrounding context. Unlike earlier static embeddings such as Word2Vec or GloVe, but similar to ELMo, BERT produces different embeddings for the same word depending on how it is used in a sentence, allowing it to capture polysemy and subtle semantic distinctions. This context sensitivity is achieved by pretraining the model on large corpora using objectives such as masked language modeling, which encourages the model to infer missing tokens from both left and right context simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Architecturally, BERT is based on an **encoder-only Transformer**, consisting of stacked self-attention and feed-forward layers without a decoding component. The self-attention mechanism enables each token to directly attend to all other tokens in the input sequence, making BERT inherently bidirectional and well suited for understanding tasks rather than text generation. As a result, BERT embeddings encode rich syntactic and semantic information and can be used effectively for a wide range of downstream NLP tasks, either as fixed contextual representations or fine-tuned end-to-end for task-specific objectives. BERT is trained using two learning objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Masked Language Model (MLM):** During training, a fixed proportion of input tokens (typically around 15%) is selected at random and their original identities are hidden from the model. These selected tokens are replaced with a special `[MASK]` token most of the time, and the model is then trained to predict the original tokens using the surrounding context on both the left and right. The learning objective is to maximize the likelihood of the correct original tokens at the masked positions, effectively turning the task into a multi-class classification problem over the vocabulary. This objective forces BERT to build representations that integrate information from the entire sentence, since the masked token cannot be predicted using only local or unidirectional context. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP):** A training sample for BERT contains pairs of sentences. In 50% of the cases, the second sentence truly follows the first one in the original corpus; in the other 50%, it is a randomly sampled sentence from the corpus. The two sentences are concatenated into a single input sequence, separated by a special `[SEP]` token, and a classification token `[CLS]` is added at the beginning. The model is then trained to predict whether the second sentence is the actual continuation of the first. The goal of NSP is to encourage BERT to capture inter-sentential coherence and discourse-level information, which is important for tasks involving sentence pairs, such as question answering and natural language inference. By framing this as a binary classification problem over the `[CLS]` representation, BERT learns to encode not only the meaning of individual sentences but also how sentences relate to each other in context. \n",

    "During training, the total loss is determined by the two learning objectives: The **MLM loss** is computed only over the masked token positions. For each masked position, BERT predicts a probability distribution over the vocabulary, and the loss is the sum (or average) of the cross-entropy between these predictions and the true original tokens. Unmasked tokens do not directly contribute to the MLM loss, although they influence it indirectly through self-attention by providing context. The **NSP loss** is a binary classification loss computed from the final hidden state of the `[CLS]` token. The model predicts whether the second segment is the actual next sentence or a random one, and a cross-entropy loss is applied to this prediction. The overall pretraining loss is the sum of the MLM loss and the NSP loss, jointly optimizing BERT to learn both token-level contextual representations and sentence-level relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "After training, for a given input sequence, the BERT model outputs a sequence of hidden states (one vector per input token) from each Transformer encoder layer. Each of these vectors encodes the meaning of its corresponding token conditioned on the entire input sequence via self-attention. In practice, the **token-level embedding** for each input token is typically taken from the final encoder layer, though some applications combine representations from multiple layers (e.g., by concatenation or averaging) to capture different levels of linguistic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to token-level embeddings, BERT also produces a special **sequence-level embedding** associated with the `[CLS]` token. This vector is commonly used as a holistic representation of the entire input sequence or sentence pair, especially for classification tasks.

    "##### Beyond BERT &mdash; Beyond Encoder-Only\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT was a landmark model in NLP as it was the first widely successful approach to learn contextual word embeddings using the Transformer architecture. However, the subsequent explosion of **decoder-only LLMs** and **encoder-decoder LLMs** has broadened the landscape for learning word (and text) embeddings. These models, initially optimized for text generation, can be adapted to produce contextual embeddings using techniques like pooling hidden states or contrastive fine-tuning. As a result, a wide range of alternative methods &mdash; spanning encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder architectures &mdash; have emerged to generate embeddings tailored to semantic search, clustering, or task-specific representation learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Encoder-decoder architectures:** Learning word embeddings from encoder-decoder architectures (e.g., T5, BART) is relatively straightforward since we still have the encoder. Much like in BERT, the encoder hidden states are typically used, much like in BERT. Since the decoder is primarily optimized for autoregressive generation conditioned on the encoder output, its hidden states are less commonly used for standalone word embeddings, although they can be useful when embeddings are needed in the context of sequence-to-sequence tasks. Additionally, some approaches fine-tune encoder-decoder models with contrastive or supervised objectives to produce embeddings optimized for semantic similarity or retrieval tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Decoder-only architectures:** Learning word embeddings from decoder-only architectures (such as GPT-style models) is less straightforward than with encoder-only models because these architectures are designed for autoregressive, left-to-right text generation. By default, each token's hidden state only attends to preceding tokens, producing unidirectional contextual embeddings. For many downstream tasks requiring bidirectional context, this can be limiting. To better adapt decoder-only architectures for embedding tasks, several strategies are employed. One approach is removing or modifying causal masking, allowing each token to attend to all positions in the input, effectively mimicking bidirectional attention as in encoder-only models. Another approach is introducing masked language modeling (MLM) or contrastive objectives during fine-tuning, which encourages the model to learn embeddings that capture semantic similarity rather than solely predicting the next token. \n",

    "\n",
    "Text embeddings extend the idea of word embeddings by representing larger units of language such as sentences, paragraphs, or entire documents, as single vector representations. While word embeddings capture the meaning of individual tokens, they cannot directly encode how words interact or combine to form the meaning of longer texts. Text embeddings address this limitation by aggregating, transforming, or contextualizing the information from multiple words into a fixed-length vector that reflects the semantics of the full text. This enables downstream tasks, such as semantic search, clustering, or classification, to operate on entire texts rather than relying solely on word-level comparisons, providing a more holistic and meaningful representation of language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most text embedding models designed for sentences, paragraphs, or entire documents apply a fixed mapping from text to vector once training is complete. At inference time, the model parameters are frozen and the embedding is computed solely from the input text, without conditioning on surrounding documents, user intent, or task-specific signals. As a consequence, the same sentence or paragraph will always be mapped to the same vector representation, provided the model and preprocessing remain unchanged. This determinism simplifies deployment, caching, and indexing, which is why such embeddings are widely used in large-scale retrieval and clustering systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the representation of a text does not vary with external context or usage, these embeddings are commonly described as *static* at the sentence or document level. While they may still rely on internally contextualized token representations, the final embedding is fixed for each input string and therefore treats meaning as an intrinsic property of the text itself. This design trades some expressiveness for efficiency and reproducibility, making static text embeddings a practical and robust choice for many downstream applications. However, at the end, we briefly discuss how static methods could be used to generate contextual embeddings."

In a one-hot representation, each word in the vocabulary is mapped to a high-dimensional sparse vector with a single non-zero entry indicating the word’s identity. When representing a text rather than an individual word, BoW simply aggregates these one-hot vectors for all words appearing in the text. Summing the one-hot word vectors yields a single vector whose entries correspond to word counts (or frequencies), preserving the same vocabulary-aligned coordinate system used at the word level.\n",

The resulting text embedding lives in the same space as the word embeddings and can be interpreted as a histogram over the vocabulary, capturing which words occur and how often.

In many document-level problems, such as topic classification, sentiment analysis, spam detection, or information retrieval, the key signal lies in *what* words appear rather than *where* they appear.

For example, consider two documents $d_A$ and $d_B$ that are of similar length that both contain the term *\"mayor\"*, and let's assume that *\"mayor\"* appears 10 times in $d_A$ and 100 times in $d_B$. While it is fair to say the term *\"mayor\"* is more indicative, informative, important to describe $d_B$ than $d_A$, saying that it is 10 times more important might be a very strong assumption. Therefore, to dampen the effect of the raw counts, the TF-IDF uses a sublinear function to calculate the term frequency weights. The most common choice if of a sublinear function is the logarithm, resulting in the following formula to calculate the term frequency weights $w_{t,d}$ of a term $t$ in a document $d$:"

However, now let's also assume that the term *\"mayor\"* also appears in many other documents of our corpus $D$ and not just in document $d_i$. Based on this observation we can make the argument that *\"mayor\"* is actually not really that useful to describe $d_i$. In other words, terms that are (very) common across most (or maybe even all) documents in a corpus are arguably not that important after all, even if they appear frequently in individual documents.\n",

In contrast, *\"elect\"* only appears in $d_1$ and in no other document of the corpus.

    "There are multiple ways to compute TF-IDF weights, differing in how term frequency (TF) is scaled (e.g., raw counts, logarithmic scaling, or normalization) and how inverse document frequency (IDF) is defined (e.g., smoothed, probabilistic, or corpus-dependent variants). These design choices are largely heuristic and motivated by empirical effectiveness rather than a unifying theoretical framework. As a result, there is no formal theory that guarantees one particular TF-IDF formulation to be optimal across tasks or datasets; instead, different variants tend to perform better in different settings, and their usefulness is typically justified through practical performance and simplicity rather than theoretical optimality.\n",

While BoW treats all words as equally important, TF-IDF downweights very common terms that appear in many documents and are therefore less discriminative, and upweights words that are frequent in a specific document but rare overall. This helps the representation focus on content-bearing terms that better distinguish between documents, which often leads to improved performance on tasks such as document classification, clustering, and information retrieval without increasing model complexity."

    "#### SPLADE (Sparse Lexical and Expansion Model)\n",
    "\n",
    "SPLADE (Sparse Lexical And Expansion) embeddings are a family of sparse text representations designed to bridge the gap between classical lexical retrieval models and modern neural approaches. Built on top of pretrained Transformer encoders such as BERT, SPLADE produces high-dimensional but sparse vectors that align naturally with inverted-index-based retrieval systems. Unlike dense embeddings, SPLADE representations preserve explicit lexical dimensions corresponding to vocabulary terms, enabling efficient retrieval while retaining much of the semantic generalization power of neural language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key characteristic of SPLADE is that it does not rely on the hidden states of BERT's transformer layers as embeddings. Instead, it uses the output distribution of the model's masked language modeling (classification) head, which predicts vocabulary terms given the input context. These output scores are interpreted as weighted lexical expansions, indicating how strongly each vocabulary term is associated with the input text. Through sparsity-inducing regularization, SPLADE learns to activate only a small subset of informative terms, yielding sparse embeddings that capture both exact term matching and contextual expansion in a single unified representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below provides an intuition of this idea. For each word of the input sequence, the classification head of the BERT model returns a probability distribution over the vocabulary &mdash; around $30k$ words (more specifically: tokens). In the example, we show illustrate this distribution for the two words *\"watched\"* and *\"effects\"*. The argument is that all \"peaks\" of a probability distribution reflect a (closely) related word. SPLADE then describes the whole input text as the aggregate (i.e., simple sum and normalization) across all words."

    "In general, the probability distributions are not sparse vectors as the probabilities for most words are greater than $0$, even if they are very small. SPLADE enforces sparsity explicitly through its training objective, rather than relying on architectural constraints alone. The model achieves high sparsity &mdash; often with over 99% of the vector dimensions being zero &mdash; through three primary mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ReLU activation** (the initial \"zero-out\"): SPLADE applies the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) function to the logits. Thus, any word that the model predicts as having a negative importance score is immediately set to exactly zero. Since most words in a $30k$-word vocabulary are irrelevant to a specific input sentence, ReLU \"kills\" the vast majority of these dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Log-saturation effect:** After ReLU, SPLADE aggregates the scores from all input words to create a final document or query vector. It uses a logarithmic transformation. The logarithm prevents any single term from having an excessively high weight. In the context of sparsity, this \"flattens\" the distribution of scores. When combined with training losses (see next), it makes it easier for the model to push unimportant terms down to zero rather than letting them linger at low positive values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sparsity regularization (FLOPS loss):** While ReLU and log-saturation provide the structural *potential* for sparsity, the model is explicitly trained to be sparse using a regularization term added to the main ranking loss. The most common loss used is the FLOPS (Floating Point Operations) loss. It minimizes the squared sum of the average weights across a batch of documents. This loss penalizes the model for \"activating\" too many tokens. It forces the model to be selective, ensuring that only the most semantically relevant tokens (and their expansions) receive non-zero weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this approach SPLADE expands a text into a sparse set of weighted vocabulary terms that includes both original words and semantically related ones. This expansion is learned end-to-end, allowing the model to activate dimensions corresponding to synonyms, paraphrases, or closely related concepts. The resulting representation remains interpretable and efficient like classic sparse methods, while significantly improving recall in retrieval scenarios by reducing lexical mismatch. In this way, SPLADE combines the strengths of symbolic and neural approaches: sparse, explainable representations that nevertheless capture semantic relationships beyond the surface form of the text."

By demonstrating that neural language models can produce sparse, high-dimensional vectors that retain semantic awareness while remaining compatible with inverted indexes, SPLADE bridged a long-standing gap between traditional lexical retrieval and dense neural embeddings. This combination delivered strong empirical gains &mdash; particularly in recall and robustness to vocabulary mismatch &mdash; while preserving interpretability and efficiency, two properties that are often lost in dense representations.\n",

    "#### Aggregation for Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic and widely used approach to generate text embeddings for sentences or documents is to aggregate the embeddings of the individual words that appear in the text. This idea naturally extends from word-level representations to text-level representations and can be applied to both static word embeddings**, such as Word2Vec, GloVe, or fastText, where each word has a single vector, and contextual word embeddings, such as those produced by ELMo or BERT, where each token embedding already incorporates information from its surrounding context.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its simplest form, this aggregation is performed by **averaging** the word embedding vectors, resulting in a single fixed-length representation regardless of text length. An alternative approach to aggregate word embeddings can be implemented using different **pooling** strategies, most commonly mean pooling, but also max pooling or sum pooling over the token embeddings. When applied to contextual models like BERT, pooling is typically performed over the hidden states of the tokens in the sequence, rather than relying on a single special token representation. While these simple aggregation-based methods ignore higher-level compositional structure, they provide an efficient and surprisingly strong baseline for many tasks, and they form the conceptual foundation for more advanced sentence and document embedding techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply averaging word embeddings treats all words as equally informative, which is rarely the case in natural language. Very frequent function words such as *\"the\"*, *\"is\"*, or *\"of\"* appear in almost every sentence and therefore dominate the aggregated representation, even though they contribute little to the semantic meaning of the text. As a result, naive averaging tends to blur distinctions between sentences and documents, producing embeddings that are overly influenced by global frequency patterns rather than by content-bearing words. Introducing additional steps such as **smoothing or weighting** before aggregation helps mitigate this problem by explicitly accounting for word importance. By down-weighting frequent words and relatively emphasizing rarer, more informative terms, the aggregated embedding better reflects the semantic content of the text. This often leads to more discriminative and stable text embeddings, forming a principled bridge between simple averaging methods and more sophisticated neural sentence embedding models."

    "[**Doc2Vec**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4053) (Le and Mikolov, 2014) is a natural extension of the Word2Vec framework designed to learn fixed-length vector representations for larger pieces of text such as sentences, paragraphs, or entire documents, rather than just individual words. While Word2Vec captures semantic relationships at the word level by learning embeddings from local word co-occurrence patterns, it does not directly provide a single embedding that represents a whole text. Doc2Vec addresses this limitation by introducing an explicit document-level representation that complements word embeddings, enabling the model to capture the overall semantic meaning of longer texts in a compact vector form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, Doc2Vec follows the same distributional learning principle as Word2Vec (i.e., texts with similar contexts should have similar embeddings) but augments the training objective with a document identifier. This document vector acts as a **shared memory** that represents the topic or global semantics of the text and is learned jointly with word embeddings during training. As a result, Doc2Vec produces dense, low-dimensional text embeddings that can be directly used for downstream tasks such as document classification, clustering, and semantic search, making it a foundational method for document-level representation learning in NLP. Like Word2Vec, Doc2Vec is not a single method but comes in two main variants: **PV-DM** (Distributed Memory Model of Paragraph Vectors) and **PV-DBOW** (Distributed Bag-of-Words version of Paragraph Vectors).\n",
    "\n",
    "**PV-DM.** The Distributed Memory Model of Paragraph Vectors (PV-DM) can be seen as a direct extension of the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) model from Word2Vec. PV-DM augments this setup by introducing a paragraph (or document) vector that represents the entire text segment. This paragraph vector serves as a persistent memory that captures the global semantics or topic of the paragraph, complementing the local contextual information provided by the surrounding words. More technically, PV-DM adds an additional embedding matrix $\\mathbf{D}$ that maps each paragraph id to a single dense vector representation. This paragraph vector is then combined (e.g., by concatenation or averaging) with the embeddings vectors of the context words to predict the center word. The figure below illustrates this idea."

    "During training, both the word embeddings and the paragraph embeddings are learned jointly through this prediction task. By conditioning word predictions on a shared paragraph-level representation, PV-DM produces vector representation for each document in the training data. To generate vector representations for **unseen documents**, PV-DM uses an \"inference stage\" that treats the new document as a mini-training session. To this end, PV-DM initializes a new document vector (usually randomly) and then optimizes only this vector while keeping all word vectors fixed. The model runs a few iterations of gradient descent to adjust the document vector so that it is good at predicting the words in the document under the same objective used during training. Intuitively, this process finds the document vector that best explains the observed words given the learned word semantics. Although this inference step is slower than a single forward pass in modern encoder models, it allows Doc2Vec to assign meaningful embeddings to arbitrary new documents without retraining the entire model.\n",

As a result, the model avoids combining multiple word vectors for each training instance, leading to fewer vector lookups and simpler computations per update, which directly translates into faster training. But like the PV-DM model, PV-DBOW also learns only vector representations for all paragraphs (or documents) in the training corpus.

While Skip-gram operates at the word level, learning word embeddings by predicting surrounding words given a center word, Skip-Thought lifts this idea to the sentence level. Instead of treating words as the basic unit of meaning, Skip-Thought treats entire sentences as atomic units whose representations should capture the information needed to explain their neighboring context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concretely, Skip-Thought learns a sentence embedding by training a model to **predict the preceding and subsequent sentence** given an input sentence, rather than predicting nearby words. By requiring the embedding of a sentence to be informative enough to reconstruct its neighboring sentences, the model is encouraged to encode semantic content, syntax, and discourse-level information. In this way, Skip-Thought generalizes the Skip-gram objective from local word contexts to broader sentence contexts, providing a natural unsupervised framework for learning distributed sentence representations from raw text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skip-Thought is built around an **encoder-decoder architecture** that explicitly separates sentence representation from sentence generation. The encoder processes the input sentence (typically using an RNN) and compresses it into a single fixed-length vector that serves as the sentence embedding. The resulting sentence embedding is then used to condition one or more decoders, whose task is to generate the surrounding sentences in the original text. Given the embedding of the center sentence, the decoder predicts the words of the preceding and subsequent sentences, usually in an autoregressive manner. By training the model to reconstruct neighboring sentences from this single vector, Skip-Thought forces the encoder to produce embeddings that are informative about the broader discourse context in which the sentence appears."

The main motivation for using different decoders is that the tasks of predicting the preceding and the subsequent sentence are **not symmetric** and therefore benefit from separate parameterizations. Language has a strong directional structure: the sentence that comes before a given sentence often serves a different discourse role (e.g., introducing context, setting up entities or topics) than the sentence that follows it (e.g., elaborating, explaining consequences, or continuing a narrative). A single shared decoder would be forced to model both distributions simultaneously, potentially blurring these distinct patterns."

While BERT excels at generating contextualized token representations, it was not originally trained to yield sentence-level embeddings that can be compared directly using similarity measures such as cosine similarity. As a result, naive approaches, such as using the `[CLS]` token or averaging token embeddings, often perform suboptimally for tasks like semantic similarity, clustering, or retrieval.\n",

    "SBERT extends BERT by placing it in a **siamese or triplet network architecture** and training it with sentence-level objectives. The basic concept of such architectures is to learn embeddings such that similar inputs are close together in the embedding space, while dissimilar inputs are far apart. In a **siamese network**, two identical subnetworks with shared weights encode a pair of inputs, and the model is trained with a loss that encourages the distance between embeddings to reflect their similarity (e.g., contrastive loss). A **triplet network** extends this idea by considering three inputs simultaneously: an anchor, a positive example (similar to the anchor), and a negative example (dissimilar to the anchor). The training objective enforces that the anchor's embedding is closer to the positive than to the negative by a margin.\n",

    "**Triplet objective function:** When training SBERT with a triplet objective, the goal is to *directly* shape the embedding space so that semantically similar sentences are closer to each other than to dissimilar sentences by a specified margin. Each training example is a triplet consisting of an **anchor sentence**, a **positive sentence** (semantically similar to the anchor), and a **negative sentence** (semantically dissimilar). The embeddings of these sentences are computed using the shared BERT encoder, and the model is trained to ensure that the distance between the anchor and positive embeddings is smaller than the distance between the anchor and negative embeddings by at least a margin $\\alpha$.

The loss is zero when the positive is closer to the anchor than the negative by at least $\\alpha$, and otherwise it penalizes violations. Triplet training is often applied to datasets derived from semantic similarity or paraphrase corpora, such as STS datasets, Quora Question Pairs, or automatically mined paraphrase collections, where positive and negative examples can be reliably identified.

    "### Consideration: Contextual Text Embeddings \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned at the beginning, most common text embedding methods are static and return the same vector representation for the same input (i.e., sentence, paragraph, or document) as this input represents the whole context. However, it is often possible to \"re-purpose\" basic text embedding models to generate contextual embedding vectors by considering granularity levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common example is to take a model that takes in paragraphs as input but returns multiple embedding vectors for each sentence in the paragraph. This is particularly easy to implement for any method that generates text embeddings by summing, averaging, or pooling word embeddings. In other words, instead of aggregating all word embeddings, we aggregate only the ones from the same sentence &mdash; sometimes called **subsegment aggregation**. Since the embedding vector of a word in a sentence depends on all words of the paragraph, now the sentence embedding also depends on the surrounding context. Thus, the same sentence used in a different paragraph will generally yield a different embedding vector."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Word and text embeddings have become a cornerstone of modern natural language processing because they provide a way to convert raw textual data into numerical representations that machine learning models, particularly neural networks, can process effectively. Text by itself is inherently symbolic and discrete, making it incompatible with operations such as matrix multiplication and gradient-based optimization that underlie most neural architectures. Embeddings solve this problem by mapping words, sentences, paragraphs, or entire documents to vectors in a continuous space, where semantic relationships are often preserved. This transformation allows models to reason about text in a mathematically meaningful way, supporting tasks from classification and sentiment analysis to retrieval and language generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings come with different characteristics that determine their suitability for specific tasks. One key distinction is **granularity**: word embeddings represent individual tokens, capturing local semantic information, while text embeddings summarize larger units such as sentences, paragraphs, or documents, integrating information across multiple words. Another important property is **sparsity**: sparse embeddings, such as traditional bag-of-words or modern methods like SPLADE, represent text with high-dimensional vectors where most values are zero, allowing for efficient indexing and interpretability. Dense embeddings, by contrast, compress information into lower-dimensional vectors, providing richer semantic representations at the cost of higher computational complexity. Finally, embeddings can be **static or contextual**: static embeddings assign the same vector to a word or text regardless of its usage, whereas contextual embeddings produce different vectors depending on surrounding words, sentence structure, or even task-specific signals, capturing polysemy and fine-grained meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategies for generating embeddings are diverse and continually evolving. Early methods like Word2Vec, GloVe, and fastText focused on static word-level embeddings learned from co-occurrence statistics or predictive objectives. Later approaches, such as ELMo, BERT, and SBERT, introduced contextualized embeddings, enabling models to represent words and sentences differently depending on the input context. Sparse contextual embeddings like SPLADE combine the interpretability and efficiency of sparse representations with the semantic richness of neural language models. Aggregation techniques, hierarchical models, and task-specific adaptations further expand the range of approaches for encoding longer texts and documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedding research remains an active and highly impactful area of study because high-quality embeddings underpin many downstream applications. They are crucial in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, semantic search engines, recommendation systems, and clustering pipelines, where embedding quality directly affects the relevance and accuracy of results. Advances in embedding techniques continue to improve the ability of models to understand and manipulate language efficiently, balancing trade-offs between expressiveness, interpretability, computational cost, and suitability for specific tasks. This ongoing innovation underscores why embeddings are both a foundational and rapidly evolving component of modern NLP."
