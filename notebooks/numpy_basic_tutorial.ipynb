    "# NumPy &mdash; Basic Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a **basic tutorial on NumPy**, one of the most essential libraries in the Python data science and machine learning ecosystem. NumPy (short for *Numerical Python*) provides powerful tools for working with numerical data, enabling efficient storage, manipulation, and computation on large arrays and matrices. Its performance and flexibility make it the foundation upon which many higher-level libraries such as Pandas, SciPy, and scikit-learn are built.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, NumPy introduces the **`ndarray`** (n-dimensional array), a data structure that is both memory-efficient and fast. Unlike Python's built-in lists, NumPy arrays allow for **vectorized operations**, meaning that computations can be applied to entire arrays at once without writing explicit loops. This not only results in cleaner and more readable code but also achieves significant performance improvements due to optimized implementations in C and Fortran under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning NumPy is essential for anyone interested in data analysis, scientific computing, or machine learning. It provides the mathematical foundation for many algorithms and models, and understanding how to efficiently manipulate arrays is a skill that translates directly into better performance and cleaner implementations in applied projects. Even when working with more abstract or high-level frameworks, a solid grasp of NumPy concepts allows you to understand what happens behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, popular deep learning libraries such as **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow** adopt much of NumPy's naming conventions and array semantics. Functions like `reshape`, `sum`, or `transpose` behave very similarly in both NumPy and PyTorch, making the **transition from NumPy to deep learning frameworks smooth and intuitive**. For this reason, learning NumPy is not just about understanding one library but also about building a strong conceptual foundation for the entire Python scientific computing stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will explore the core features of NumPy, including array creation, indexing, slicing, reshaping, broadcasting, and basic mathematical operations. By the end, you will have a practical understanding of how to work efficiently with numerical data and be well-prepared to apply these concepts to more advanced libraries and real-world problems."

    "## Multidimensional Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "In NumPy, **arrays are the core concept** and the foundation of everything the library does. A NumPy array &mdash; officially called an **`ndarray`** (n-dimensional array) &mdash; is a powerful and efficient data structure that can represent data in one or more dimensions. For example, a 1D array is like a list of numbers, a 2D array represents a matrix with rows and columns, and higher-dimensional arrays (3D, 4D, etc.) can represent complex data such as images, time series, or tensors. Unlike regular Python lists, NumPy arrays are homogeneous (all elements share the same data type) and stored in contiguous memory blocks, allowing for extremely fast numerical computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multidimensional arrays are so central to NumPy because they enable **vectorized operations** and allow performing computations on entire datasets at once without explicit Python loops. This leads to cleaner, more concise code and significant performance gains. Arrays also provide the foundation for many advanced operations such as reshaping, broadcasting, and matrix manipulation; which we will cover later. In fact, understanding how NumPy arrays work is essential for mastering not only NumPy itself but also other scientific and machine learning libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow, which build upon the same array-based concepts."

    "#### Creating Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy provides several ways to create arrays, but two of the most commonly used functions are **`array()`** and **`asarray()`**. Both functions can convert existing data such as Python lists, tuples, or nested sequences into NumPy arrays. The main difference lies in how they handle existing NumPy arrays: `array()` **always creates a new copy** of the data by default, while `asarray()` **avoids making a copy** when the input is already an ndarray. This distinction can be important for performance, especially when working with large datasets, as unnecessary copying can increase memory usage and slow down computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, `array()` is generally used when you want to ensure that your data is fully independent of the original source, such as when you plan to modify the array without affecting the input. On the other hand, `asarray()` is useful when you want to safely convert inputs to arrays while preserving memory efficiency. For example, when passing data between functions that expect NumPy arrays, `np.asarray()` ensures the correct type without redundant copying. Understanding the difference between these two functions helps you write more efficient and predictable code when initializing and managing data in NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first consider the case of creating a NumPy array by transforming a **regular Python list (or tuple). In this case, both `array()` and `asarray()` behave the same way: they create a new NumPy array that is a copy of the input data. The difference between the two functions only matters when the input is already a NumPy array. Also, When creating a NumPy array from a Python list, the list must be **well-structured and consistent**. This means that all elements should be of the **same data type** (for example, all integers or all floats). Additionally, if the list contains **nested lists**, each inner list must have the **same length**, forming a regular grid of rows and columns. If these conditions are not met, NumPy will be unable to interpret the data as a proper multidimensional array and may either create an array of type `object` (which is inefficient and not truly numerical) or raise an error. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code cell below shows several examples of a Python list, where the first two definitions can be converted into NumPy arrays, while the other two definitions will either throw an error or result in arrays containing (arguably) not the expected values. You should try each definition of `py_list` and run the code cell to see how NumPy behaves in each case."

For instance, using `dtype=float` will convert all elements to floating-point numbers, even if the original data contains integers; see the code cell below.

The `ndim` attribute returns the **number of dimensions (axes)** in the array (for example, 1 for a vector, 2 for a matrix, or more for higher-dimensional arrays). The `shape` attribute gives a **tuple describing the size of the array along each dimension**, such as `(3, 4)` for an array with 3 rows and 4 columns. Finally, the `dtype` attribute specifies the **data type** of the array's elements, such as `int32`, `float64`, or `bool`, indicating how the data is stored in memory. Together, these attributes provide a complete description of a NumPy array's structure, helping you understand its dimensionality, layout, and element type; all of which are crucial for performing correct and efficient numerical computations.\n",

However, once we move beyond two dimensions, there is no intuitive concept of rows or columns anymore. Instead, each additional dimension adds another level of structure to the data that cannot be accurately described using just \"rows\" and \"columns\". For this reason, it is more meaningful and precise to use the terms **\"dimensions\"** and **\"axes\"**.

    "### Views of Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have an array, we typically want to manipulate it either by changing its shape or its values &mdash; as we will see in subsequent questions. When manipulating arrays, we need to consider the concept of a **view**. A view of an array is a new array object that **shares the same data** as the original array but may have a different shape, type, or indexing. This means that a view **does not copy** the underlying data but provides a different way of looking at (or \"viewing\") the same data in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence, when you modify the elements of a view, the changes are **reflected in the original array**, and vice versa, because both arrays refer to the same data buffer. However, since the view is a separate object, you can modify its metadata (like shape or strides) independently. It is therefore important to keep in mind that some array manipulation methods return a view, while others return a copy, depending on whether the operation can safely share the same underlying data. Methods like **reshaping**, **slicing**, or **transposing** often return views, meaning they create a new array object that references the same data in memory without duplication. In contrast, operations that require rearranging or modifying the actual data layout, such as **fancy indexing**, **concatenation**, or **copy()**, return copies that have their own independent memory. Understanding this distinction is important for writing memory-efficient and predictable code. We will see examples for both cases throughout the notebook."

    "Reshaping multidimensional arrays is important because it allows you to reorganize data into the structure required for specific computations, algorithms, or machine learning models; all without changing the actual data values. Many operations in scientific computing, linear algebra, or deep learning expect data in a particular shape (for example, 2D matrices for matrix multiplication or 4D tensors for image batches). Reshaping makes it easy to convert between these representations efficiently, helping ensure compatibility between different processing steps while maintaining performance.\n",

The [`concatenate()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.concatenate.html) function joins existing arrays along an existing dimension, while [`stack()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.stack.html) creates a new dimension in the result, effectively adding another level of depth to the data structure. Both methods are used to organize and unify data stored in separate arrays for more convenient computation and analysis. The main purpose of using these functions is to **efficiently assemble data** without copying or manually iterating over elements. This is especially useful in scientific computing and machine learning, where data often comes in parts (such as batches, features, or samples) that need to be merged for processing. \n",

It provides a flexible way to combine arrays that share the same shape in all dimensions **except** the one along which concatenation takes place &mdash; specified by the `axis` parameter. For example, assuming a 2D array (i.e., a matrix), if you concatenate along `axis=0` (rows), all arrays must have the same number of columns. Also, the arrays must be **compatible data types** (e.g., all numeric, or all strings) so that NumPy can store them in a single resulting array. The code cell below shows an example. Since both 2D arrays `a` and `b` have the same shape, we can concatenate them along either of the two axes."

In other words, `stack()` increases the dimensionality of the output array by one, whereas `concatenate()` preserves the original number of dimensions. For instance, stacking two 1D arrays creates a 2D array, while concatenating them keeps the result 1D.

    "### Splitting Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of combining multiple arrays into one, we can also split an array into multiple smaller arrays. The general purpose of splitting multidimensional arrays is to divide large datasets into smaller, manageable sub-arrays for easier processing, analysis, or computation. By breaking an array into parts, you can apply different operations to each segment, parallelize computations, or selectively manipulate sections of the data without affecting the whole array. Splitting is particularly useful when working with high-dimensional data, such as images, time series, or multi-channel signals, where processing the entire dataset at once may be inefficient or unnecessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common use cases include **batch processing in machine learning**, where a large dataset is split into smaller batches for training; **image processing**, where an image array may be divided into patches for filtering or feature extraction; and **data analysis**, where a 2D table of data can be split into separate columns or row groups for statistical computations. Splitting is also useful for **parallel computation**, enabling different parts of an array to be processed concurrently across multiple cores or machines. In essence, splitting arrays allows more flexible, memory-efficient, and modular handling of multidimensional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first consider the [**`split()`**](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.split.html) method, which is used to **divide an array into multiple sub-arrays** along a specified axis. It allows you to partition an array either into **equal-sized sections** or at **specific index positions**, depending on the argument provided. The basic form is `split(array, indices_or_sections, axis=0)`, where `indices_or_sections` can be an integer (for equal splits) or a list of indices (to split at certain points). The `axis` parameter determines the direction of the split &mdash; rows (`axis=0`), columns (`axis=1`), or higher dimensions. In the code cell below we split our previous `(3, 4)` array row-wise (`axis=1`) into 3 equal parts. Naturally, since we only have 3 rows, the result subarrays will have only 1 row each."

    "**Side note:** All split methods ultimately use **array slicing** under the hood to create the resulting subarrays. When you split an array, NumPy does not copy the data for each piece; instead, it typically creates views that reference portions of the original array's memory using slice indices. This slicing-based approach makes splitting operations very efficient, since no new data is allocated. However, if the input array is not contiguous in memory or requires reshaping for the split, NumPy may create copies instead of views. In general, though, NumPy's split methods rely on **index-based slicing** as their core mechanism for partitioning arrays. We cover slicing in more detail when we talk about **array indexing** in a later section."

    "Just looking at these examples, at should be obvious that the [`resize()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.resize.html) method should be used with care because it **modifies the original array in place** and can **change its total number of elements**, potentially leading to data loss or unintended duplication. If the new size is smaller, excess elements are permanently discarded, and if it is larger, the method repeats existing data to fill the new shape, which can produce misleading or meaningless values. Additionally, if the array is a **view of another array** (i.e., it shares memory), the method will raise an error since changing its size would break that shared memory structure. For these reasons, [`resize()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.resize.html) is powerful but potentially destructive, so best use it only when you are sure that altering the original data and its shape will not cause inconsistencies."

It allows users to retrieve or manipulate data efficiently without the need for explicit loops. The main purpose of array indexing is to enable efficient data manipulation and analysis by providing direct, fine-grained control over array elements. It is essential for tasks like filtering, reshaping, or updating values in large datasets. Array indexing in NumPy can be done using different methods:\n",
    "\n",

    "* **Slicing:** Slicing is a common indexing technique that allows you to extract a contiguous portion of an array. It involves specifying a range of indices using the colon (:) symbol. Slicing can be used to retrieve rows, columns, or sub-arrays from a larger array.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Boolean indexing:** Boolean indexing enables you to select elements from an array based on a given condition or a boolean mask. You can create a boolean mask by applying a logical condition to the array, and then use the mask to extract elements that satisfy the condition.\n",

    "Array indexing in NumPy is highly flexible and allows for both read and write operations. You can access and modify individual elements, extract subsets, or assign new values to specific locations within an array.

    "This result is arguably not that intuitive. However, it becomes more clearer when the integer array indexing is rewritten as a multiple basic integer indexes &mdash; which is what is going on under the hood when using multiple index arrays for different axes. In short, When multiple integer index arrays are used for different axes, the arrays are **combined element-wise** to select elements from the array. This means that NumPy pairs elements from each index array based on their position in the arrays: the first elements of each index array select one element, the second elements select another, and so on. The code cell below illustrates this."

Common aggregate functions include [`np.sum()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.sum.html) for summation, [`np.mean()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.mean.html) for the average, [`np.min()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.min.html) and [`np.max()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.max.html) for finding extreme values, [`np.std()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.std.html) and [`np.var()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.var.html) for measuring variability, and [`np.median()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.median.html) for determining central tendency. These functions can be applied to an entire array or along a chosen axis, allowing users to summarize data across rows, columns, or higher dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, let's consider [`np.sum()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.sum.html) for our examples; the other aggregation operations behave the same way. First, we can sum up all the elements in an array (i.e., ignoring specific axis):"

    "**Broadcasting** in NumPy is a powerful mechanism that allows arithmetic operations to be performed on arrays of **different shapes** without explicitly reshaping or replicating data. The concept relies on \"stretching\" the smaller array along the axis where its size is 1 (or missing) so that it matches the shape of the larger array. This enables element-wise operations between arrays that would otherwise be incompatible, without consuming extra memory for repeated copies. Broadcasting is applicable whenever the shapes of two arrays are **compatible** according to specific rules: starting from the trailing axes, the axes must either be equal, or one of them must be $1$. \n",

This means, if we add both arrays, we add `b` to each entry of `a` along the second axis.

    "The **arg\\*** methods are functions that return the **indices of elements** in an array that satisfy certain conditions, rather than the values themselves. The most commonly used methods are [`np.argmax()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.argmax.html) and [`np.argmin()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.argmax.html), which return the index of the maximum or minimum element in an array, respectively. These methods can operate on the entire array or along a specified axis in multidimensional arrays, making it easy to identify the location of extreme values in large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a conrete example, let's consider [`np.argmax()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.argmax.html). The method returns the **index of the first occurrence of the maximum value** in an array. It works by scanning the array (or along a specified axis for multidimensional arrays) to identify the element with the largest value and then returning its **position** rather than the value itself. The position or index of the maximum values is the position or index of the flattened version of the array. This implies that the index is always a single value. This also means that, if we want to use the index to actually get the maximum value, we need to either\n",

    "* Convert the scalar index to the corresponding multidimensional index with respect to the shape of the input array.\n",

    "When you're new to NumPy (or data science with Python, in general), the usefulness and power of indexing, slicing, broadcasting, and so on are unlikely to be very obvious from just going through this notebook so far and running the basic examples. The benefits of NumPy really begin to shine when actually using it to solve problems and perform computation that utilize NumPy arrays. Therefore, in the last part of the notebook, we go through some concrete use cases to see how NumPy can make our lives easier. The two use cases are still very simple, but should still be able to appreciate that solving using NumPy yields a shorter and cleaner implementation &mdash; in practice, typically also a much faster one, but given the toy data we use here, you won't see a noticeable difference."

    "### Finding the K-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "The k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) are data points in a dataset that are most similar or closest to a given query point in a feature space. In the k-NN algorithm, the k nearest neighbors are identified based on a distance metric, such as Euclidean distance or cosine similarity. These neighbors play a crucial role in making predictions or determining the similarity of the query point. The k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) problem is a widely used algorithm in machine learning and data mining. It is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression tasks. Some common applications of the k-NN problem include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Classification:** k-NN can be used for classifying data points into different categories. Given a new data point, the algorithm identifies the k nearest neighbors based on a distance metric (such as Euclidean distance) and assigns the class label that is most common among its k nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Regression:** In addition to classification, k-NN can also be used for regression tasks. Instead of assigning class labels, the algorithm estimates the value of a target variable based on the average or weighted average of the target values of its k nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Recommender systems:** k-NN can be applied to recommend items to users based on their similarity to other users or items. For example, in collaborative filtering, the algorithm can find similar users and recommend items that those similar users have liked or purchased.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Anomaly detection:** k-NN can be used to identify outliers or anomalies in a dataset. The algorithm measures the distance of a data point to its k nearest neighbors, and if a point is significantly distant from its neighbors, it can be considered as an anomaly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Image recognition:** k-NN can be used in image recognition tasks. Given an input image, the algorithm can compare it with a set of labeled images to determine the class label of the input image based on the labels of its k nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Text classification:** k-NN can be applied to classify text documents based on their similarity. By representing documents as vectors, such as using the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) representation, the algorithm can find the k most similar documents and assign a class label based on those neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples of the many applications of the k-nearest neighbor problem. Its simplicity and effectiveness make it a popular choice in various fields where pattern recognition and similarity-based analysis are required. For the following example, we create a random dataset `D` of $10$ data points, with each data point featuring $5$ attributes/features/coordinates. This means that `D` can be represented as a matrix (2D array) of shape `(10, 5)`. We also need a data point `x` for which we want to find the k-nearest neighbors. Naturally, `x` must have the same number of $5$ attributes/features/coordinates."

    "### Feature Scaling: Standardization\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature scaling or standardization is an important preprocessing step in data mining and machine learning. It involves transforming the features or variables of a dataset to a common scale or range. Here are the key reasons why feature scaling is important:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Avoiding bias due to different scales:** Features in a dataset often have different scales and units of measurement. For example, one feature might have values ranging from 0 to 100, while another feature could range from 0 to 1000. These differences in scales can introduce bias in certain machine learning algorithms that are sensitive to the magnitude of features. Scaling the features ensures that they are on a similar scale, preventing certain features from dominating the learning process solely because of their larger values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Enhancing convergence and performance:** Many optimization algorithms used in machine learning, such as gradient descent, rely on the assumption that features are on a similar scale. When features have vastly different scales, the convergence of these algorithms can be slow or inefficient. By scaling the features, optimization algorithms can converge more quickly, leading to faster and more accurate models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Facilitating distance-based algorithms:** Algorithms that utilize distances or similarities between data points, such as k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) or clustering algorithms, are sensitive to the scale of features. Without proper scaling, features with larger scales can dominate the distance calculations and influence the results disproportionately. Scaling the features ensures that all features contribute fairly to the distance calculations and allows for more reliable and meaningful comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Improving model performance and interpretation:** Feature scaling can positively impact the performance of various machine learning models. Models such as support vector machines (SVMs), k-NN, and neural networks often benefit from feature scaling, as it aids in finding optimal hyperplanes, improving decision boundaries, and ensuring efficient model training. Furthermore, feature scaling can make the coefficients or weights in linear models more interpretable and comparable, as they represent the importance or contribution of each feature on a common scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common methods of feature scaling include normalization (scaling features to a specific range, e.g., `[0, 1]`) and standardization (scaling features to have zero mean and unit variance). The choice of scaling method depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the dataset and the machine learning algorithms being used. Overall, feature scaling or standardization is crucial in data mining as it promotes fairness, efficiency, and effectiveness in various machine learning algorithms, improves model performance, and aids in meaningful interpretation of results.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is a fundamental Python library for **numerical computing** that provides support for efficient manipulation of large arrays and matrices, along with a wide range of mathematical operations. At its core, NumPy introduces the **ndarray**, a high-performance multidimensional array object, which allows for fast, vectorized operations on large datasets. Unlike Python's native lists, NumPy arrays are **memory-efficient**, support **element-wise arithmetic**, and integrate seamlessly with low-level optimized code, making them ideal for computationally intensive tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key strengths of NumPy is its comprehensive set of **array manipulation and mathematical functions**, including element-wise operations, aggregate functions, and linear algebra routines. Its support for **broadcasting** allows arithmetic between arrays of different shapes without explicit loops, enabling concise and readable code. Additionally, NumPy's `arg*` methods, matrix operations, and random number generation utilities make it invaluable for **data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and simulation** tasks, which are common in data science and scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another major advantage of NumPy is its **efficiency and speed**. Because most operations are implemented in optimized C and Fortran code under the hood, array computations are often orders of magnitude faster than equivalent Python code using loops. This performance is crucial when working with large datasets, performing numerical simulations, or training machine learning models, where computational bottlenecks can otherwise slow down workflows significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being proficient in NumPy is particularly important for **machine learning and deep learning** because it forms the foundation for more advanced frameworks such as **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**. These frameworks use concepts like multidimensional tensors, broadcasting, and vectorized operations that are directly inspired by NumPy. A solid understanding of NumPy not only helps in **writing efficient code** but also makes it easier to learn and understand the behavior of these libraries, enabling faster experimentation and model development.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, NumPy is more than just a library for arrays, it is a **cornerstone of modern data science and scientific computing**. Its strengths in efficient array manipulation, fast mathematical operations, and support for linear algebra make it indispensable for tasks ranging from data analysis to machine learning. Mastering NumPy provides a strong foundation for working with other Python-based computational frameworks and is an essential skill for anyone pursuing careers in **data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, or scientific research**."
