    "# RNN-based Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were once the dominant architecture for natural-language generation and sequence modeling, playing a crucial role in the evolution of modern deep learning. While they have largely been surpassed by Transformers, RNNs remain extremely valuable for learning how sequential models work at a fundamental level. In this notebook, we will train an RNN-based language model (specifically an LSTM) from scratch using PyTorch. The goal is not to build a state-of-the-art system but to understand each step of the process, from preparing the data to building the model and performing backpropagation through time (BPTT).\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep the focus on the concepts rather than computational complexity, we will train on a dataset of 100,000 movie reviews. This dataset is large enough to expose the real-world challenges of training sequence models &mdash; such as handling long sequences, learning useful token representations, and managing hidden states &mdash; yet small enough to allow fast experimentation on standard hardware. Working with a text corpus of this size provides a realistic demonstration of issues that arise when scaling RNNs, such as vanishing gradients, limited long-range memory, and the need for truncated BPTT.\n",
    "\n",
    "RNNs process text one time step at a time while maintaining a hidden state that is passed forward through the sequence. This sequential processing makes them intuitive to understand but also highlights their major limitations. Training is inherently slow due to the lack of parallelism, and long-range dependencies are difficult to capture because the hidden state must compress everything seen so far. These difficulties are exactly what motivated the development of the Transformer architecture, which replaces recurrence with attention, enabling full parallelism and more effective learning of long-distance relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "By building an LSTM language model from the ground up, you will gain a deeper appreciation of how sequence models operate internally and why training them can be challenging. Understanding these limitations provides essential context for understanding why Transformers became the standard for NLP and why architectural shifts were necessary. Throughout the notebook, we will focus on clarity, practical implementation decisions, and conceptual insight rather than model performance, making the learning process both accessible and grounded in real-world considerations.\n",

    "\n",
    "The [**ACL IMDB (Large Movie Review) dataset**](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) is a popular benchmark dataset for sentiment analysis, introduced by Andrew Maas et al. (2011). It contains a total of 100,000 movie reviews collected from IMDb, with 50,000 reviews being labeled as either *positive* or *negative* and evenly split into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. For training Word2Vec word embeddings we do not need the sentiment labels. We therefore already preprocessed the original dataset such that all 100,000 reviews are in a single file, with 1 line = 1 review. This preprocessing included the removal of any HTML tags and line breaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the training of our model, we make the common assumption that the training data is structured as continuous streams of documents, with each movie review representing a document. Document streams refer to the way text data is fed into the model during training: not as isolated documents, but as a continuous stream of text. Instead of treating each document as an independent unit, the training corpus is viewed as a long sequence of tokens coming from many documents concatenated together. This approach allows the model to learn language patterns and long-range dependencies across boundaries that would otherwise be artificially imposed by document splits. The training process still ensures that context resets appropriately between documents (e.g., by inserting special end-of-document tokens `[EOS]`), but from the model's perspective, the data flows in a seamless stream. Thus, assuming $\\text{doc}_{i}$ is a list of tokens represents the $i$-th documents, our document stream has the following format:"

    "Document streaming is essential for efficient batching and scaling when training on massive corpora. LLMs are typically trained on trillions of tokens spread across billions of documents, and it's computationally impractical to load entire documents or reinitialize contexts for each. Instead, data pipelines tokenize all documents in advance, concatenate them, and then dynamically sample fixed-length chunks (e.g., 1024 tokens) to feed into the model. This \"streaming\" setup keeps GPUs fully utilized and allows distributed training systems to continuously stream data without needing to restart or reshuffle individual documents frequently."

    "### Tokenize & Generate Token Stream\n",
    "\n",
    "Early RNN-based language models were typically trained on **word-level vocabularies**. Each word was treated as an atomic symbol with its own embedding, which made the models simple to conceptualize and train. However, this approach came with significant drawbacks. Word vocabularies must be extremely large to cover real text, often reaching hundreds of thousands of tokens, which dramatically increases memory requirements. More importantly, word-based models cannot naturally handle unseen or rare words, forcing them into a generic `<unk>` (unknown) token that discards important information and weakens the model's ability to generalize.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, **subword tokenization** such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), SentencePiece, or WordPiece became the standard for modern language models, including Transformer-based systems. Subword vocabularies strike a balance between characters and words: they are small enough to be efficient, yet expressive enough to represent any word by composing smaller units. This eliminates the `<unk>` problem entirely, improves handling of rare and morphologically rich words, and reduces vocabulary size dramatically, which helps models train more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "For RNN-based models, subword tokenization offers the same advantages: fewer out-of-vocabulary issues, smaller embeddings, and more robust representations of linguistic structure. While RNNs were not originally trained this way due to computational limitations and tooling complexity at the time, subword units now provide a more scalable and practical foundation for any neural language model, regardless of architecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is why we will be using subword tokenization in this notebook by means of a pretrained tokenizer. More specifically, we are using GPT-2 tokenizer to handle both the tokenization and indexing for us. The GPT-2 tokenizer is a subword tokenizer based on the **Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)** algorithm. In nutshell, BPE (and similar approaches) learns how to tokenize words from data. Instead of splitting text strictly into full words or individual characters, BPE breaks words into frequently occurring subword units. For example, *\"unhappiness*\" might become *\"un\"*, *\"happi\"*, and *\"ness\"*. This enables the model to represent common words as single tokens while decomposing rare words into smaller, reusable pieces, preventing the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem that word-level tokenizers suffer from. Because subword tokens capture meaningful morphological patterns (prefixes, suffixes, roots), models can infer the meaning of new or compound words based on familiar subparts. This reduces the total number of parameters needed for embeddings and improves the model's ability to generalize to unseen text. You can learn all about BPE in a separate notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "To load the pretrained GPT-2 tokenizer, we can use the `AutoTokenizer` class Hugging Face Transformers library. This class is a high-level interface that automatically selects the appropriate tokenizer for a given pretrained model, abstracting away the need to know the specific tokenizer class. The `from_pretrained` method is used to load a tokenizer that has already been trained on a specific model's vocabulary and tokenization rules, either from the Hugging Face model hub or a local path. This method ensures that the tokenizer is configured consistently with the pretrained model, including token-to-ID mappings, special tokens, and any subword tokenization schemes (e.g., BPE), making it ready for encoding text into token IDs suitable for model training or inference. The code cell below used the class and method to load the GPT-2 tokenizer."

In a small corpus, many words appear only a handful of times, and treating uppercase and lowercase forms as separate tokens (e.g., *\"Movie\"* vs. *\"movie\"*) further fragments the data. By converting everything to lowercase, the model encounters each word more frequently, allowing it to learn better embeddings and stronger statistical patterns from limited examples. This makes training more stable and reduces the risk of overfitting to infrequent capitalized variants.\n",

    "Additionally, the goal in many educational or exploratory projects is to understand the mechanics of training sequence models and not to capture subtle linguistic nuances such as proper noun capitalization. Lowercasing simplifies preprocessing, reduces noise, and helps the model focus on learning the core structure of the language rather than expending capacity on orthographic variations. For small-scale experiments, this trade-off is highly beneficial: you get cleaner data, faster training, and more reliable results without sacrificing the insights the project aims to teach."

    "### Create `Dataset` and `DataLoader`\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch's `Dataset` class provides a clean and modular way to represent and access your data. It allows you to define how individual samples are loaded, whether they come from tokenized text, images on disk, or preprocessed tensors. This abstraction keeps the data logic separated from the model and training loop, making your code easier to maintain and allowing you to swap in different datasets without changing the rest of your pipeline. The `DataLoader` builds on top of a `Dataset` to efficiently feed data to the model during training. It handles batching, shuffling, and parallel data loading through worker processes, which significantly speeds up training and keeps the GPU fully utilized. Together, `Dataset` and `DataLoader` provide a flexible and scalable framework for handling data in PyTorch, allowing you to focus on model design and experimentation rather than manually managing data batching or iteration logic."

    "### Batching Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Like most language models, RNN–based language models are motivated by the need to capture sequential dependencies in language, where the meaning of each word often depends on the words that came before it. Because natural language is inherently ordered, RNNs process text one token at a time, updating an internal hidden state that summarizes everything seen so far. To train such models to understand and generate coherent text, they are typically optimized using the next-word prediction task: given a sequence of input tokens, the model must predict the next token at every time step. This setup naturally encourages the model to learn patterns of grammar, vocabulary, and long-range dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this training objective, the target sequence is simply the input sequence shifted one position to the left. For example, if the input is *\"I like the movie very\"*, the model is trained to predict *\"like the movie very much\"*; this figure below illustrates this idea. This formulation is elegant and powerful because it directly aligns the model's predictions with the structure of language, making it possible for the model to learn how each word follows from its preceding context. Through repeated exposure to large corpora, the RNN becomes able to generate fluent text by repeatedly applying this next-word prediction ability."

    "In principle, we could feed our continuous stream of tokens to the RNN. However, RNNs are typically restricted in maximum sequence length because their ability to preserve information over time degrades as sequences grow longer. During training, gradients must be propagated backward through every time step, and this repeated multiplication can cause them to vanish or explode. Vanishing gradients make it difficult for the model to learn long-range dependencies, while exploding gradients can destabilize training altogether. Although variants like LSTMs and GRUs mitigate these issues with gating mechanisms, they still struggle when sequences become very long.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, longer sequences also increase computational cost and memory usage, since the hidden state and gradients for every time step must be stored during training. This limits the practical maximum sequence length that can be processed efficiently on modern hardware. As a result, even though RNNs are theoretically capable of handling arbitrarily long sequences, in practice they perform best when trained on moderately sized segments that balance computational feasibility with the ability to capture meaningful context. We therefore need to split our token stream into fixed-size chunks and pass the chunks to the model during training\n",
    "\n",
    "To maximize training efficiency, we also do not want to pass single chunks but batches containing more than one chunk in one training step. A naive approach would be to treat each chunk independently and reset the hidden state for each batch of chunks. However, treating each batch independently and resetting the hidden state at every batch boundary prevents the model from carrying information across sequence segments. Since RNNs rely on their hidden state to encode contextual information from previous tokens, resetting it means the model \"forgets\" everything it has learned about the text up to that point. This effectively breaks the continuity of the training data and prevents the model from learning dependencies that span beyond the fixed sequence length used in each batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the model only learns relationships within individual segments rather than across the natural flow of the corpus. This can significantly weaken its ability to model long-range structure (such as topic shifts, document-level coherence, or dependencies spanning many sentences) because the hidden state is never allowed to accumulate context over longer stretches of text. For this reason, some training approaches like truncated backpropagation through time (TBPTT) maintain hidden states across batches within the same sequence stream, allowing the RNN to capture longer-term patterns while still keeping training manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To organize our dataset to properly support TBPTT, we have to make sure that the $k$-th chunk in the $i$-th batch is a continuation of the $k$-th chunk in the $(i\\!-\\!1)$-th batch. To illustrate this, let's assume that our token stream contains the token $1$ to $60$ as shown below:"

    "### Implementing Custom `DataSet` Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know in which format we have to bring our training data, we can implement a custom `DataSet` to achieve this. More specifically, create a class that inherits from the [IterableDataset](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.IterableDataset) class. This dataset class is designed for scenarios where data must be generated or streamed sequentially rather than randomly accessed. Unlike the standard `Dataset` class, which assumes that individual samples can be indexed (`__getitem__()`), an `IterableDataset` only requires the implementation of an `__iter__()` method that yields data samples one at a time. This makes it ideal for use cases such as reading data from large text files, streaming logs, or generating data on the fly—situations where random access is impossible or inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because `IterableDataset` produces samples in a fixed order, it gives the user precise control over the data flow, which is especially useful for tasks like language modeling with long text streams, reinforcement learning, or online learning. However, this sequential nature also means that certain DataLoader features (e.g., shuffling or automatic batching) are limited or behave differently. This includes that we have to implement batching ourselves &mdash; but we know how to do it (see the figure above). Despite these constraints, `IterableDataset` is a powerful tool when working with continuous or very large datasets that don't fit neatly into memory or require sequential processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class `StreamDataset` in the code cell below implements the approach. When passing the initial array of `tokens`, the `batch_size`, and the sequence length `seq_len` of all sequences within a batch, the constructor performs the following three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(1) Compute the number of usable tokens:** This step refers to ignoring the last tokens in each substream which are insufficient to form a full batch. We can compute this number by first computing the number of full batches by dividing the total number of tokens by the batch size using an integer division (without remainder). The number of usable tokens is the number of batches, and then multiplied again by the number of batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(2) Create substreams:** We can create all `batch_size` substreams by reshaping the original 1-dim array of tokens into a 2-dim array of shape `(batch_size, stream_len)` where `stream_len` is the number of tokens in each substream &mdash; this number is, of course, the number of usable tokens divided by the batch size (i.e., the number of streams). Having all streams in a single array makes creating the final batches very easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(3) Compute total number of batches:** Even if now the last batch is guaranteed to be full (i.e., all sequences have a length of `seq_len`) we still want to ignore it since we still could not generate the target sequences by shifting the inputs sequences $1$ token to the left &mdash; again, we could add an `[EOS]` token but we simply do not have to. Thus, to get the final number of batches, we simply use an integer division to divide the lengths of the streams $-1$ by `seq_len`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `__iter__()` method simply iterate overall valid batches numbers (i.e., their index from `0` to `n_batches-1`) to generate all input sequences and target sequences by slicing the 2-dim array that holds all substream. Notice the `+1` as part of the slicing for the target sequences. This implements the shifting of the tokens by $1$ token to the left."

In the loop, when each batch is passed to the model, the hidden states gets updates but *not* reset. When training an RNN with *stateful* or *continuation* batches (i.e., where the hidden state from the previous batch is reused for the next), the hidden state must be **detached** to prevent gradients from propagating endlessly through the entire training history. Without `detach()`, PyTorch treats the hidden state as part of the computational graph and keeps linking new operations onto that graph at every step. This causes the graph to grow without bound, dramatically increasing memory usage and eventually causing the training process to crash or slow down severely.\n",

This keeps training efficient, bounded in memory, and still allows the RNN to keep its stateful behaviour across batches without unintentionally backpropagating across the entire dataset.

    "### Saving & Loading Checkpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "Training a Transformer-based LLM requires a lot of training, even for a rather small model trained using a rather small dataset. A **checkpoint** in model training is a saved snapshot of the model's state at a specific point during training, typically after a certain number of steps or epochs. It usually includes the model's parameters (weights and biases), the optimizer state (to resume learning with the same momentum and learning rate adjustments), and sometimes metadata like the current epoch or training loss. This allows training to be paused and later resumed from that point without starting over, which is especially important for large models that take days or weeks to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "While many libraries have built-in support for periodically saving checkpoints, in this notebook, we purposefully use only PyTorch and avoid libraries with a higher level of abstraction. However, saving a checkpoint is very straightforward. The method `save_checkpoint()` defined in the code cell below takes a model and optimizer instance, as well as the information about the current epoch and epoch loss. The method combines all required information to resume training into a single object and uses the `save()` method of PyTorch to save this object to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In PyTorch, the `state_dict()` object is a Python dictionary that contains all the learnable parameters and persistent states of a model or optimizer. For models, it stores mappings from each layer's name to its corresponding tensor values (like weights and biases). For optimizers, it includes the current state of optimization variables such as momentum buffers and learning rate schedules. This dictionary enables easy saving, loading, and transferring of model and optimizer states, making it central to checkpointing and model deployment. By calling `torch.save(model.state_dict())`, you can preserve a model's learned parameters, and later restore them with `model.load_state_dict()`, ensuring the model continues exactly where it left off."

    "Naturally, the counterpart to saving a checkpoint is loading a save checkpoint, as implemented by the method `load_checkpoint()` below. Notice that this method also takes in a model and optimizer instance. In other words, the method does not create a model or optimizer but sets the state of both instances as the states read from the checkpoint file. This of course only works if the model and the optimizer have the same \"structure\" as the model and optimizer used for training. For example, we cannot train a Transformer model with 4 layers and then load its state into a model with more or less layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, notice the `map_location` parameter of PyTorch's `load()` method. This parameter controls how tensors are remapped to devices (like CPU or GPU) when loading a saved model or checkpoint. This is useful when the model was trained on one device but needs to be loaded on another; for example, loading GPU-trained weights onto a CPU-only machine. By specifying `map_location='cpu'`, all tensors are loaded to the CPU regardless of where they were originally saved, while `map_location='cuda:0'` loads them to the first GPU. It can also take a custom function or dictionary to flexibly remap devices, ensuring model compatibility across different hardware setups and preventing errors caused by unavailable devices."

    "Using the default parameter of the model class (see below), we are training a **2-layer RNN**. A 2-layer RNN (also called a *stacked RNN*) is a recurrent neural network where multiple RNN layers are placed on top of one another. The first RNN layer receives the input sequence, processes it over time, and produces a sequence of hidden states. Instead of sending these hidden states directly to an output layer, they are fed as inputs into a second RNN layer, which performs another round of temporal processing. This stacked structure allows the network to learn more complex hierarchical patterns in sequential data &mdash; lower layers may capture short-term or local patterns, while higher layers can model longer-term or more abstract dependencies. This deeper structure generally improves modeling power compared to a single-layer RNN, although it may require more computation and careful regularization. The figure below shows the overall architecture."

    "In this notebook, we will be using an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** network. This is a specialized type of RNN designed to overcome the limitations of a \"vanilla RNN\", particularly the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients during backpropagation through time. While a vanilla RNN uses a single hidden state that is repeatedly updated, an LSTM introduces a more complex internal structure with multiple gates &mdash; **input**, **forget**, and **output** gates &mdash; along with a **cell state** that can carry information forward over long time spans. These gates learn to regulate what information to store, update, and discard, giving LSTMs much stronger control over long-range dependencies.\n",

    "The main benefit of LSTMs is their ability to remember information over significantly longer sequences compared to vanilla RNNs. This makes them far more effective for tasks such as language modeling, translation, speech recognition, and time-series forecasting. Additionally, because LSTMs reduce gradient decay, they train more stably and capture richer patterns, while still being flexible enough to forget irrelevant information through their gating mechanisms. The class `LstmLM` implements the complete network architecture."

    "To train the model, we first need to instantiate the model itself, as well as the optimizer and the criterion (i.e., the loss function); just run the code cell below. Common optimizers for training RNN-based language models in PyTorch are largely the same as those used for other neural networks, but some are especially popular due to their stability and ability to handle sequential data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used optimizer is **Adam**, because it adapts the learning rate for each parameter, handles noisy gradients well, and generally converges faster than classical methods. Variants such as **AdamW** (Adam with decoupled weight decay) are also widely used, especially when regularization is important. Another traditional but still relevant choice is **SGD with momentum**, which can work well for RNNs when carefully tuned, though it often requires more manual learning-rate scheduling. Less common but still used options include **RMSprop**, which historically performed well on recurrent networks because it smooths gradient magnitudes over time. Overall, **Adam or AdamW** are the standard default optimizers for training RNN-based language models in PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the criterion, keep in mind that the `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` works directly on logits because it internally applies `log_softmax` to convert them into log-probabilities before computing the negative log-likelihood. This design is both numerically stable and efficient: applying `softmax` and then taking a log would risk floating-point underflow, but combining them into a single `log_softmax` step avoids these issues. As a result, you can feed raw, unnormalized model outputs (logits) directly into `nn.CrossEntropyLoss`, and it will safely and correctly compute the cross-entropy without requiring you to apply softmax yourself."

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provided a clear, step-by-step walkthrough of how to train an RNN-based language model using a simple toy dataset. Rather than focusing on scale or performance, the goal was to build intuition: how to prepare sequential data, how to construct and train a recurrent model, and how to interpret its predictions. Each component, from batching to hidden-state handling, from logits to sampling, was introduced gradually so that the underlying mechanics of recurrent models become transparent rather than obscure. Along the way, we emphasized core concepts such as truncated backpropagation through time, the importance of detaching hidden states, and sequence continuation between batches. By walking through these steps in detail, the notebook demystified what is often treated as a black box, showing how an RNN maintains and updates internal state as it processes text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although modern large language models are almost universally based on Transformers, the ideas covered here remain highly relevant. Transformers were designed in part to overcome precisely the limitations that RNNs face, such as their difficulty capturing long-range dependencies and challenges in parallelization. Understanding where RNNs struggle gives valuable insight into why attention mechanisms, residual connections, and parallel sequence processing became so central in Transformer architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, RNNs have by no means disappeared. They remain widely used in many practical domains, including speech processing, time-series forecasting, online prediction tasks, and lightweight edge models. By working through a small but complete RNN language model, this notebook highlights both the strengths and weaknesses of recurrent networks, providing intuition that helps explain the evolution of modern neural architectures &mdash; and ultimately deepens our understanding of how today's large models work under the hood."
