    "# Working with the OpenAI API &mdash; An Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The main benefit of accessing LLMs through provided APIs is that developers and organizations can leverage powerful, state-of-the-art models without needing to train or maintain them themselves. Training large language models requires massive datasets, specialized expertise, and extremely costly compute infrastructure &mdash; resources that are out of reach for most teams. With an API, all of that complexity is abstracted away, and you gain instant access to reliable, production-grade models through simple function calls in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage is flexibility and scalability. By using an API, you can integrate language understanding, reasoning, and generation into a wide range of applications &mdash; such as chatbots, search systems, content generation tools, or code assistants &mdash; without being tied to a single platform or architecture. The API ensures you always have access to the latest improvements, updates, and safety features of the model, while scaling seamlessly with demand. This allows teams to focus on building innovative applications rather than managing machine learning infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore the basic use of the **OpenAI API** with Python. The OpenAI API provides programmatic access to powerful foundation large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, which are capable of understanding and generating natural language, writing code, analyzing data, and much more. By integrating these capabilities directly into Python workflows, developers and researchers can experiment with language models in an interactive and flexible way."

    "\n",
    "* The OpenAI API is **not free**; it operates on a prepaid, pay-as-you-go model, and you must add a valid payment method and prepay at least a small amount, to use the service. OpenAI no longer provides free trial credits for new accounts, so to utilize the API, you need to fund your account with credits (note: this information may not be up to date; check the [official page](https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing) for last information about pricing).\n",
    "\n",
    "* This notebooks serves as a **basic introduction** to the OpenAI API. The API offers many endpoints and endpoint parameters, making the API very flexible and powerful. For many more and more sophisticated examples, you can check out the official [OpenAI Cookbook](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main/examples) as well as the official [API documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction).\n",

    "## Authentication & API Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of authentication when accessing an API is to verify the identity of the user or application making the request, ensuring that only authorized parties can interact with the service. This protects the API from unauthorized access, misuse, or abuse, while also allowing the provider to track usage, enforce quotas, and associate requests with specific accounts for billing or monitoring. In short, authentication establishes trust between the client and the API provider, enabling secure and accountable communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "**API keys** act as a **secure identifier** that authenticates a user or application when accessing an API. In other words, an API key proves to the service provider (like OpenAI) that the request is coming from a valid, authorized source. This ensures that only approved users can make requests and that usage can be tracked and billed appropriately. API keys also serve an important role in **usage monitoring and security**. They allow providers to enforce rate limits, track how much each user or organization is consuming, and prevent abuse or unauthorized access. For developers, API keys make it possible to integrate powerful external services into applications while maintaining control over who can access those services and under what conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OpenAI API distinguishes between two types of keys the; the main difference lies in ownership, usage scope, and billing management.:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Personal API keys** are tied directly to an individual OpenAI account. They are meant for personal use &mdash; such as testing, learning, or building small projects. Billing is linked to the individual user's payment method, and usage is tracked under that person's account. These keys are ideal if you are experimenting on your own or developing prototypes without team collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Organization API keys** are associated with an organization's OpenAI account. Multiple team members can share access, and all API usage is consolidated under the organization's billing and quotas. This makes it easier for companies, research groups, or teams to manage shared resources, monitor usage, and ensure that projects are funded centrally rather than through individual accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we assume you want to create a personal API key. If you are a member of an organization, company, or team with an organization API key, you can check with the creator of the organization to get access to the API."

    "### Creating an API Key\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an API key for accessing the OpenAI API, you must first sign in to your [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/). From the account dashboard, you can navigate to the **API Keys** section (left side bar). There, you  can the click **\"Create new secret key\"** button (top right) to generate a new API key. Once created, the key will be displayed only once, so it is important to copy and store it securely (e.g., in a password manager or environment variable). You can then use this key in your code to authenticate requests to the OpenAI API. If your key is ever compromised (e.g., accidentally shared or leaked to other people), you should revoke it immediately and generate a new one."

    "### Storing your API Key\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not a good practice to include API keys directly in your code because doing so exposes them to potential misuse. If the code is shared publicly (for example, on GitHub, in a notebook, or even within a team), the keys can easily be copied and used by unauthorized parties. This can lead to unexpected costs, data breaches, or service abuse since the API provider cannot distinguish between your legitimate use and someone else's.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, best practice is to store API keys securely outside of your code &mdash; for example, in **environment variables**, a **configuration file that is excluded from version control**, or a **secrets manager**. Your application can then load the key at runtime without exposing it in the source code, keeping access secure while still enabling smooth integration. In the following, we describe how you can store your newly generated OpenAI API key using an environment variable; this depends on your type of operating system."

    "OpenAI provides a variety of models via its API, each optimized for different tasks, levels of performance, and cost. The primary categories include **GPT models for text generation and understanding**, **embedding models for semantic representations**, and **multimodal models that handle text, images, or audio**. Within these categories, there are multiple versions and variants, such as the GPT-4 family, GPT-3.5, and specialized models like `gpt-4o-mini`, each designed to balance capabilities, speed, and cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT models differ mainly in **performance, capabilities, and pricing**. For instance, GPT-4 models are more capable than GPT-3.5 in terms of reasoning, creativity, and handling complex instructions, but they are also more expensive per token and may have higher latency. Lighter variants like `gpt-4o-mini` provide faster responses at a lower cost but may sacrifice some depth of reasoning or nuance. This allows developers to choose models based on the specific needs of their application, whether that’s high-quality content generation, interactive chatbots, or rapid prototyping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedding models, on the other hand, are optimized for **representing text or other data in high-dimensional vector spaces** for tasks like search, clustering, or recommendation. They generally have lower costs than full GPT models because they are specialized and do not perform free-form text generation. Finally, multimodal models expand the range of tasks to include **image understanding, audio transcription, and code generation**, offering flexibility for applications that require multiple types of input or output. By offering a range of models with different strengths and pricing, OpenAI enables developers to select the most suitable tool for their project while balancing performance and cost.\n",

    "### Chat / Conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "The `client.chat.completions.create` endpoint is used to generate responses in a conversational format. This endpoint is optimized for chat-based interactions where input and output are structured as a sequence of messages between roles such as \"system\", \"user\", and \"assistant\". This structure allows developers to define context (e.g., rules or instructions with \"system\"), provide user queries (\"user\"), and receive coherent, context-aware responses (\"assistant\"). It is commonly used for building chatbots, virtual assistants, customer support agents, and other interactive applications that require back-and-forth dialogue. The endpoint supports advanced features like function calling, multi-turn memory, and response formatting, making it versatile for both natural conversation and structured tasks such as querying APIs, summarization, or data extraction.\n",

    "Let's run this method with a simple example prompt. We use the **`gpt-3.5-turbo`** model as it offers a strong balance of performance, cost, and speed, making it one of the most practical models for real-world applications. It is significantly faster and cheaper than previous GPT-3 models while maintaining high-quality responses suitable for conversational AI, text generation, and reasoning tasks. Its optimization for chat-based interactions allows developers to build scalable applications like chatbots, support agents, and content tools without incurring the higher costs of larger models like GPT-4, making it an efficient choice for both experimentation and production. \n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the client and the model, the example below only includes a \"user\" prompt (and ignoring all other roles). However, notice how the user prompt is an element of a list which is the value for the argument `messages`. This list can easily be extended to include additional prompts from the other two roles (\"system\" and \"assistant\")."

This design aligns naturally with how most real-world applications &mdash; such as chatbots, assistants, or tutoring systems &mdash; interact with users. Beyond simple dialogue, the endpoint's flexibility comes from its ability to handle advanced features like function calling, tool integration, and structured output formatting.

    "### Responses\n",
    "\n",
    "The `client.responses.create` endpoint is a newer, more flexible alternative to the classic `chat.completions.create` endpoint in the OpenAI API. It is designed as a **unified interface for generating model outputs**, whether they are plain text, structured responses, or tool-augmented actions. Instead of requiring a structured array of `messages`, it accepts a simpler `input` field, and it can return richer, event-based outputs in addition to plain text. This makes it easier to integrate into applications that need structured data, streaming responses, or more complex workflows. The endpoint is primarily used for **building stateful, agent-like applications**. It supports features such as maintaining conversational context across requests (via `previous_response_id`), calling external tools (e.g., web search, file search, code execution), and producing structured outputs like JSON that align with schemas. In practice, this means developers can use this endpoint not just for chatbots, but also for advanced assistants, reasoning tasks, and applications where the model must interact with external systems in a controlled, reliable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "A minimal working example for calling the `client.responses.create` endpoint is shown in the code cell below. Note that unlike `client.chat.completions.create` endpoint, which requires a messages array with roles (\"system\", \"user\", \"assistant\"), the newer `client.responses.create` endpoint works differently. You do not explicitly assign roles like \"system\" or \"assistant\" in the same way. Instead, you provide input, which can be plain text or a list of structured content items. If you need role-like behavior (e.g., system instructions vs. user input), that is handled through the input structure or by passing system-level instructions separately. The Responses API is designed to be simpler and more general-purpose, so it abstracts away explicit roles. We will see more practical examples in later in this notebook"

    "The `moderations.create` endpoint of the OpenAI API is a specialized tool for **content safety**. Its main purpose is to analyze a given piece of text (or an image, with newer models) and determine if it violates OpenAI's usage policies. This is a critical step for developers to proactively filter or flag harmful content, such as hate speech, self-harm, sexual content, or violence, before it is displayed to users or processed by a language model. The API returns a classification of the content across a variety of categories, along with a boolean flag indicating if any policy was violated. The models suitable for this endpoint are specifically trained for moderation tasks. The most up-to-date and recommended model is `omni-moderation-latest`, which is built on GPT-4o and supports both text and image inputs, with improved accuracy, especially for non-English languages. There is also a legacy model, `text-moderation-latest`, which only handles text. The use of the moderation API is **free of charge**, and it is a vital component for any application that handles user-generated content, acting as a powerful and scalable guardrail for content safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code cell below lists a few example prompts you can try with this endpoint, but you can also write your own prompts to see how well the model performs. We use the  **`omni-moderation-latest`** model as it should be used when calling the moderation endpoint because it is OpenAI's most up-to-date, accurate, and cost-efficient moderation model. This model is continuously improved to better detect harmful or policy-violating content. By always pointing to `-latest`, developers automatically benefit from ongoing updates without needing to change their code whenever a new moderation model is released."

    "\n",
    "The `embeddings.create` endpoint of the OpenAI API is used to convert text (or other data types) into high-dimensional numerical vectors, known as **embeddings**. Embeddings capture the **semantic meaning** of the input, so texts with similar meanings have vectors that are close to each other in the vector space. Unlike text generation endpoints, which produce human-readable outputs, embeddings are primarily used for mathematical and computational operations such as similarity comparison, clustering, or search. This endpoint is commonly used for semantic search and information retrieval. By embedding both a query and a collection of documents, developers can measure the similarity between them using cosine similarity or other distance metrics. This allows applications to retrieve the most relevant documents even if the exact words in the query do not appear in the documents, making it far more powerful than traditional keyword-based search. Embeddings are also widely used in recommendation systems, clustering, and classification tasks. For example, they can help group similar customer reviews, recommend similar products, or categorize content based on semantic meaning. \n",
    "\n",
    "A minimal example using this endpoint is, again, very easy to implement. We use a simple prompt and the **`text-embedding-3-small`** model. This model offers a highly efficient and cost-effective solution for generating embeddings while still maintaining strong performance across semantic search, clustering, classification, and recommendation tasks. Compared to larger embedding models, it is much faster and cheaper, making it ideal for large-scale applications where millions of vectors need to be computed or stored. Despite its smaller size, it delivers competitive accuracy in capturing semantic meaning, making it a practical default choice for most use cases that balance quality with affordability."

    "These embedding vectors can then be used to perform a variety of tasks that rely on measuring similarity or clustering of texts. For example, in semantic search, you can compare the embedding of a query with embeddings of a document database using cosine similarity or Euclidean distance to find the most relevant documents. Similarly, embeddings can be used for clustering similar texts, which is useful for topic modeling, grouping customer feedback, or organizing large text corpora. Embeddings are also commonly used for recommendation systems, where items (e.g., products, articles, or media) are represented by embeddings and recommendations are made by finding items with vectors closest to a user's preferences. In classification tasks, you can feed embeddings into a downstream machine learning model to predict categories based on the semantic content of the text.

By automating transcription, it saves time and reduces the need for manual note-taking or transcription services.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test the endpoint, we provide a small mp3 file from a speech recognition dataset containing a voice recording of an English speaker. You can listen to the recording using the built-in audio play below to check if the transcription indeed matches the recording."

    "We can now take this mp3 file, load it as a binary file, and pass it as value for the `file` argument of the endpoint. This is rather different to previous endpoints, since `audio.transcriptions.create` does not expect a text prompt as input. The response, however, is a simple JSON document containing the string representing the transcript of the file. The **`whisper-1`** model is OpenAI’s speech-to-text system, designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks such as transcribing spoken language into written text. It is built on top of the open-source [Whisper architecture](https://openai.com/index/whisper/), which was trained on a large, diverse, and multilingual dataset, giving it strong performance across many languages, dialects, and noisy environments."

    "#### Translations\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to transcriptions, the `audio.translations.create` endpoint is designed to **translate spoken audio from one language into another written language**, typically English. You provide an audio file in a supported format (like MP3, WAV, or M4A), and the model processes the audio to generate a translated text output. This endpoint also uses the **Whisper model**, which is capable of both transcription and translation, making it suitable for multilingual audio content. This endpoint is commonly used for localizing audio content**, such as interviews, lectures, podcasts, or international meetings, into a target language for broader accessibility. It enables applications like multilingual transcription services, global content distribution, and real-time translation tools, where users can understand spoken content in languages they may not speak. By automating translation of audio, it reduces the need for manual translation and allows developers to integrate multilingual capabilities directly into their software.\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, let's use a short mp3 file containing a voice recording of a Spanish speaker to test the endpoint."

    "The audio endpoint using the **Whisper model** for speech-to-text is powerful for transcription and translation but has several limitations. **Accuracy** can be affected by background noise, overlapping speakers, heavy accents, or low-quality audio recordings, which may lead to misinterpretations or incomplete transcriptions. The model may also struggle with specialized vocabulary, technical jargon, or rare languages, limiting its reliability for domain-specific applications. There are also **practical constraints** like latency, file size limits, and rate restrictions. Large audio files require longer processing times and more tokens, which can increase costs and slow real-time applications. Additionally, the API outputs primarily textual transcriptions, meaning it does not natively provide speaker diarization, emotion detection, or other enriched audio analyses without additional processing. These factors make the audio endpoints best suited for general-purpose transcription and translation rather than high-precision or highly interactive audio analysis tasks."

    "### Images\n",
    "\n",
    "The `images.create` endpoint is used for **text-to-image generation**, where you provide a written prompt and the model produces an image that matches the description. This endpoint leverages models like **`gpt-image-1`**, which are trained to interpret natural language prompts and translate them into detailed, coherent visuals. You can also specify parameters such as image size or the number of variations, giving flexibility in how images are generated. It is commonly used for creative content generation, design prototyping, and visualization tasks. For example, developers and artists can use it to generate concept art, marketing materials, or illustrative graphics without requiring manual design work. Businesses can also use it to create product mockups, social media visuals, or personalized artwork at scale. By enabling programmatic image generation, this endpoint allows applications to dynamically produce visual content tailored to user input or specific scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's run &mdash; or at least try to run &mdash; this function with some simple prompt. The **`gpt-image-1`** model is designed for image generation and editing based on text prompts. It allows users to create new images from scratch, modify existing ones (such as adding, removing, or altering objects), and even apply style transformations, all guided by natural language descriptions. In the example below, we only use the model to generate an image for a given text prompt. Apart from the model and the prompt, the size of the generated images is an important argument here. At the time of writing, the only supported values are: *\"1024x1024\"*, *\"1024x1536\"*, *\"1536x1024\"*, and *\"auto\"*. The response of the call is not the image itself but a URL pointing to the generated image. If needed, this image can then be downloaded using some additional simple code."

    "**Important:** Depending on your exact OpenAPI account, you are likely to get an error. The OpenAI API endpoint for generating images requires a verification process primarily to prevent misuse and ensure responsible access. Image generation models can be used to create realistic or harmful visual content, including deepfakes, violent imagery, or copyrighted material. By requiring identity verification, OpenAI can confirm that users are accountable for how they use the service, which helps mitigate risks associated with the distribution of unsafe or illegal content. This also allows OpenAI to enforce usage policies and comply with legal and regulatory requirements. Additionally, verification helps manage resource allocation and abuse prevention. Generating images is computationally intensive, and unrestricted access could lead to excessive or malicious usage that impacts service availability for legitimate users. By verifying accounts, OpenAI can tie usage to a responsible entity, monitor usage patterns, and apply safeguards such as rate limits, ensuring that the API remains reliable and sustainable for everyone. This process balances accessibility with safety and ethical considerations for AI-generated visual content."

    "### Files & Fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "The OpenAI API provides functionality not only for interacting with pre-trained models but also for **customizing models through fine-tuning**. Two key endpoints in this process are `files.upload` and `fine_tunes.create`. These endpoints enable developers to prepare training data, upload it to OpenAI, and create a fine-tuned version of an existing model that is better suited for specific tasks or domains:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`files.upload`**: this endpoint allows users to securely upload files to OpenAI's servers for use in fine-tuning or other purposes. Typically, these files are in **JSONL format**, where each line represents a training example with a `\"prompt\"` and a `\"completion\"` field. This endpoint ensures that the training data is properly formatted, stored, and accessible for subsequent fine-tuning processes. Users receive a **file ID** after uploading, which acts as a reference to the uploaded file in other API calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`fine_tunes.create`** this endpoint is used to initiate a **fine-tuning job**. This endpoint takes the base model (e.g., `davinci` or `curie`) and the uploaded file ID as input and begins the process of training a new model that adapts the base model to the custom dataset. Fine-tuning allows the model to perform better on domain-specific tasks, produce consistent outputs, and follow particular styles or instructions defined in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these endpoints form a workflow that makes **model customization accessible and manageable**. By uploading curated training datasets and initiating fine-tuning jobs, developers can leverage OpenAI's powerful models while tailoring them to specific business, research, or application requirements. This capability is particularly valuable for applications that require high accuracy in niche domains, specialized terminology, or unique response patterns that generic pre-trained models may not handle optimally. However, since fine-tuning a model involves the collection, cleaning, and preparation of a training dataset, using those endpoints is beyond the scope of this notebook."

    "\n",
    "The `completions.create` endpoint is designed for **single-turn text generation**. You provide a prompt, and the model generates a continuation or response based on that prompt. This endpoint is suitable for tasks such as summarization, creative writing, code generation, or completing a text snippet. It uses the traditional completion models (like `text-davinci-003`) and does not require the chat-style `messages` format. You can control the output using parameters like `max_tokens`, `temperature`, and `stop` sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this endpoint is considered a **legacy endpoint** because it predates the newer **chat-based API** (`chat.completions.create`) that is now the recommended standard for most text generation tasks. While it still works for generating text from a prompt, it lacks the built-in mechanisms for managing conversational context that chat models provide. OpenAI’s newer chat endpoints are more flexible and better suited for modern applications, including multi-turn interactions, role conditioning (system, user, assistant), and improved handling of instructions. The chat API also supports newer, more capable models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o, which are optimized for conversational reasoning. Because of these advantages, `completions.create` is now mostly maintained for backward compatibility, while developers are encouraged to use `chat.completions.create` for new projects."

    "The `edits.create` endpoint of the OpenAI API is a legacy endpoint that was specifically designed to **edit or correct** a piece of text. Its main purpose was to take an existing input string and an instruction, then return the edited version of the text. This was a dedicated API for tasks like proofreading, rewriting a sentence to be more concise, or fixing grammatical errors. The key advantage was its focused functionality for a specific task, differing from general text generation. However, this endpoint, along with the models it was designed for, has been officially deprecated by OpenAI. The models `text-davinci-edit-001` and `code-davinci-edit-001` were created for this purpose. OpenAI now recommends using the `chat.completions.create` ot `responses.create` endpoints with their newer, more capable models for all text editing and correction tasks. The modern chat-based models, such as `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `gpt-4`, are more versatile and can perform editing tasks with greater accuracy and flexibility by simply providing a clear instruction in the prompt."

    "The `responses.create` endpoint is the next-generation interface of the OpenAI API, designed to go beyond traditional chat completions. Unlike the older `chat.completions.create` endpoint &mdash; which relies on a fixed `messages` structure with roles &mdash;the Responses API accepts a more flexible `input` format and provides richer, structured outputs. It supports not only text generation, but also stateful conversations, tool usage, and structured response formats such as JSON. This makes it especially well-suited for building agent-like applications, assistants that interact with external systems, and workflows requiring precise control over output.\n",

We will first walk through the different arguments supported by `responses.create`, explaining how each affects the model's behavior. We will then explore a series of practical examples, starting with simple text generation and moving towards more advanced use cases such as structured outputs, reasoning control, and multi-turn interactions with memory. By the end, you should have a clear understanding of how to leverage the Responses API to build powerful and flexible AI applications."

A lower value (close to 0) makes the model more focused and deterministic, consistently choosing the most likely responses, which is useful for tasks requiring accuracy and reliability. A higher value (closer to 1 or above) increases randomness, encouraging more diverse and creative outputs, which is useful for brainstorming or generating varied text; `top_p` behaves in a similar way.

    "\n",
    "The **`instructions`** field in the `responses.create` endpoint is used to provide high-level guidance to the model, similar to how the \"system\" works in the older Chat Completions API. Instead of mixing long-winded setup text into the main `input`, you can separate global directives (e.g., *\"You are a helpful tutor who explains concepts step by step\"* or *\"Always respond in JSON format\"*) into the `instructions` parameter. This helps clearly distinguish **meta-level guidance** from the actual user request, making prompts easier to manage, reuse, and maintain. This is especially useful when building applications where the **style, tone, or constraints** must remain consistent across multiple interactions. By centralizing these instructions, you avoid repeating them in every `input` and reduce prompt engineering overhead. For example, you might set `instructions` to ensure the assistant always responds formally, while the `input` can change dynamically with each user query. This separation of concerns makes your system more modular and easier to scale for complex or multi-turn use cases."

    "### Chaining Responses\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, as done in the previous example, all endpoint calls are independent from each other. However, this causes problems for creating conversation needed in applications such as chatbots. A conversation is characterized by **interdependent statements**, where each utterance depends on and shapes the meaning of the next. Unlike isolated sentences, conversational statements are linked through context, reference, and coherence: a response usually presupposes what was said before (e.g., answering a question, clarifying a claim, or challenging a point). This creates a chain of dependencies, where meaning is built incrementally rather than contained in single, standalone statements. These dependencies can take different forms, mainly:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Referential dependencies:** Referential dependencies in a conversation occur when an utterance uses words or expressions (like pronouns, definite descriptions, or ellipses) that rely on earlier statements for their meaning. For example, in *\"I met Sarah yesterday.\"* &mdash; *\"Oh, what did she say?\"*, the pronoun *she* depends on the prior mention of *Sarah*. These dependencies help maintain coherence while avoiding repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Logical dependencies:** These dependencies in a conversation arise when one statement relates to another through reasoning, such as agreement, contradiction, cause-and-effect, or providing evidence. For instance, if someone says, *\"It's going to rain\"*, and the other replies, *\"Then we should bring umbrellas\"*, the second statement logically depends on the first. These dependencies drive the progression of ideas and support coherent argumentation or decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pragmatic dependencies:** A pragmatic dependency in a conversation occurs when a statement's meaning or appropriateness depends on the social context, speaker intentions, or conversational norms rather than just literal content. For example, if someone says, *\"Can you pass the salt?\"* the expected response is to hand over the salt, not to comment on one's physical ability. These dependencies ensure that contributions remain relevant, polite, and aligned with the shared goals of the interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, you can preserve the context \"manually\" by adding all previous prompts and their responses to a history (e.g., a list of previous prompts and responses), and call the endpoint with this history together with the new prompt. The Responses API simplifies this by introducing the concept of **chaining**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chaining responses using the `responses.create` endpoint allows you to maintain **stateful, multi-turn conversations** without manually resending the entire conversation history. By passing the `previous_response_id` from an earlier response, the API can automatically carry forward context, instructions, and relevant conversation data. This simplifies building applications where the model needs to remember prior interactions, such as chatbots, tutoring systems, or task-oriented assistants. It effectively enables the model to \"remember\" what has been discussed, reducing the need for clients to reconstruct full conversation context on every call. This approach is particularly useful for **agentic or multi-step workflows**, where the model’s response in one step might influence the next step. For example, you could generate an initial answer, then ask the model to refine, expand, or perform additional calculations based on that output. Chaining responses in this way not only improves efficiency and reduces token usage but also makes your application logic cleaner and easier to maintain, since the API handles context propagation automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code cell below shows a simple example using chaining by calling the endpoint twice, and the second call uses the `id` of the first response as the value for the `previous_response_id` argument. Notice how the second prompt would be completely meaningless without the context of the first prompt and its returned response. Using chaining allows you to much better mimic natural conversation."

    "While chaining can enable sophisticated workflows (e.g., multi-step reasoning, retrieval-augmented generation, or structured data extraction) it introduces the risk of **error propagation**. If an early step produces an incorrect, ambiguous, or incomplete result, subsequent steps may compound the mistake, ultimately affecting the accuracy and reliability of the final output. Unlike a single-step response, the correctness of the chain depends not only on the model’s reasoning but also on the design of the intermediate prompts and how information is passed between steps. Chaining also comes with practical constraints. Each additional step requires a separate API call, which increases **latency and cost**, potentially making real-time applications slower or more expensive. Maintaining context across multiple steps can be challenging, especially for long or complex workflows, as the model may lose track of earlier details if prompts are not carefully structured. Developers often need to implement **state management**, caching, or summarization strategies to preserve context and ensure consistency, adding complexity to the application. While powerful, chaining requires careful planning to balance accuracy, performance, and cost."

    "### Reasoning Levels\n",
    "\n",
    "The **`reasoning`** argument allows you to control how the model approaches complex tasks or multi-step problem solving. Essentially, it provides a way to guide the model's internal reasoning process, such as specifying whether it should use more thorough, step-by-step thinking or produce a quicker, less detailed response. This can be particularly useful when accuracy, logical consistency, or structured problem solving is important, for example in coding tasks, math problems, or data analysis. By adjusting the `reasoning` parameter, developers can **balance performance and computational cost**. For instance, a higher reasoning effort might generate more reliable and detailed explanations but could take slightly longer and consume more tokens, while a lower reasoning setting could be used for simpler tasks where speed is more critical than depth. This makes it a powerful tool for tailoring the model’s behavior to the specific needs of your application, ensuring that outputs are aligned with your desired level of rigor and reliability. Valid values for `reasoning.effort` are\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`low`**: The model performs minimal reasoning, leading to faster responses with less detailed explanations. This setting is suitable for straightforward tasks where speed is prioritized over depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`medium`**: The default setting, balancing between speed and detailed reasoning. It provides adequate depth for most tasks without significant delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`high`**: The model engages in extensive reasoning, offering thorough and detailed explanations. This setting is ideal for complex problems requiring careful analysis and step-by-step breakdowns.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to note that not all models support all parameters within `reasoning`. Models that support it include `o1`, `o3`, `o3-mini` and `o4-mini`. If you try using a different model, the endpoint will respond with a corresponding error code and error message. The example below use the `o4-mini` model to process the same prompt using the three available levels of reasoning effort."

Essentially, the extra reasoning capacity may not be \"activated\" if the problem does not require deeper or multi-step inference. Another factor is that the reasoning levels primarily influence the model's internal deliberation process rather than guaranteeing a different external output. The model may internally consider more reasoning chains at higher levels, but if all chains converge to the same conclusion, the final response remains unchanged.

This structured output can then be programmatically executed by your system, ensuring reliable integration between natural language inputs and precise function calls. Function calling bridges human-friendly conversation with machine-executable actions, enabling more interactive and automated workflows.\n",

However, we have a system that is able to estimate the crowd level at different locations, maybe analyzing sensor data, noise level, or camera feeds. In short, for a given location, we can get the crowd level at the location at that location as a value between, say, $0$ (low) and $1$ (high). The function `get_crowd_level()` below illustrates this idea by returning a random value for the crowd level.

    "As the example shows, function calling provides a structured and reliable bridge between natural language and programmatic actions. Instead of parsing free-form text, developers get well-defined JSON outputs that specify the function name and its arguments, which makes automation more accurate and reduces the risk of misinterpretation. This enables seamless integration with external systems like databases, APIs, or computational tools, and allows users to interact with complex systems through simple natural language queries. Another strength is that developers can constrain the model's outputs by defining available functions and expected parameters, which improves safety, predictability, and alignment with application needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, function calling also has limitations. The model does not actually execute the function but only *suggests* when and how it should be called. This means developers still need to validate the arguments, handle errors, and ensure security when passing data to external systems. Additionally, function calling is limited by the model's understanding of context: if the user’s request is ambiguous, the model might generate incomplete or incorrect parameters. In high-stakes or mission-critical applications, relying solely on the model's judgment without proper checks can be risky. In practice, function calling is therefore most effective when combined with robust backend logic &mdash; using the model for intent recognition and argument filling, while letting the application enforce constraints, validate inputs, and control execution. This balance ensures that developers can take advantage of natural language flexibility without sacrificing reliability or safety."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI provides a suite of APIs that allow developers to integrate powerful **large language models (LLMs)** into their applications. At its core, the **Responses API** is the most flexible endpoint, capable of generating text, handling conversations, calling functions, and even using tools like web search or file analysis. Other specialized endpoints include the **Embeddings API** (for generating numerical vector representations of text, useful for semantic search, clustering, and recommendation systems), the **Audio API** (for speech-to-text transcription and translation using Whisper), and the **Image API** (for generating or editing images with models like DALL·E). Together, these endpoints cover a wide range of tasks &mdash; from natural language understanding and reasoning to multimodal generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these APIs, developers can build applications such as conversational agents, code assistants, knowledge retrieval systems, personalized tutors, and content generation tools. The ability to combine endpoints is especially powerful. For example, embeddings can be paired with a vector database for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), while function calling in the Responses API can connect an LLM to external APIs or business logic. This creates systems where the LLM not only generates text but also acts as an orchestrator of workflows, enabling richer interactivity and automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a practical standpoint, **pricing** is an important consideration. OpenAI charges on a usage basis, typically measured in tokens for text models and in seconds or images for audio and image models. More capable models (such as GPT-4.1) are priced higher than smaller, faster models (like GPT-4.1-mini), which encourages developers to balance performance with cost depending on their use case. For large-scale applications, optimizing prompts, caching responses, or mixing model tiers can help reduce expenses while maintaining quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another practical issue is **rate limits**, which cap the number of requests per minute and the maximum tokens per request. These limits vary by model and account tier, and they play a crucial role in scaling production systems. Applications that expect high user traffic need to be designed with queuing, batching, or fallback strategies to ensure a smooth experience. Additionally, developers must handle errors gracefully, as exceeding rate limits or encountering transient service issues can disrupt workflows."
