    "# Working with Batches for Sequence Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with sequential data in neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), one major problem arises when processing data in batches: sequences often have varying lengths. Unlike fixed-size inputs like images, text and time series data can have different lengths, making it difficult to create uniform batches for training. Since neural networks expect inputs of the same shape, handling sequences of different sizes requires special preprocessing techniques, such as padding or truncation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another challenge is maintaining the temporal dependencies in the data while batching multiple sequences together. RNNs, for example, process sequences step by step, maintaining a hidden state that carries information from previous time steps. When batching sequences, the model must ensure that dependencies between time steps are preserved, which becomes complicated if sequences in a batch have different lengths. Padding shorter sequences with zeros (or a special padding token in NLP) helps align batch sizes, but this can introduce redundant information that affects learning if not handled properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, in CNNs designed for sequence processing (such as 1D convolutional networks for text or time series), the issue of varying sequence lengths can complicate convolution operations. Since convolutional filters slide over fixed-size windows of input data, sequences of different lengths might require resizing, padding, or adaptive pooling strategies to ensure compatibility within a batch. If not handled properly, this can lead to loss of meaningful information or inefficient training due to excessive padding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, batching sequential data can introduce inefficiencies in computation and memory usage. When padding is used to make all sequences in a batch the same length, the model must process padded elements even though they contain no useful information. This can lead to unnecessary computations and increased memory usage, slowing down training. Advanced techniques like masking (to ignore padded elements) and dynamic batching (grouping sequences of similar lengths together) help mitigate this issue, but they add complexity to model implementation."

    "The minimum requirement for an input batch &mdash; i.e, a list of sequences grouped together &mdash; is that all sequences in the same batch have the same length. In the following, we refer to the *length of a batch* to mean to length of the sequences in the batch and the *size of a batch* to mean the number of sequences in that batch. We therefore want to create a batch of size 8 to contain all of our sentences of the example classification dataset. Right now, most of those 8 sequences have a different length, so we need to fix this.\n",

As such the result is no longer a list of 8 1d tensors but a 2d tensor with a shape of `(batch_size, max_seq_len)` where `batch_size` is 8 as the number of sequences and `max_seq_len` is 12 as the length of the longest sequence(s)."

    "**Important:** The `padding_value` cannot be chosen arbitrarily. Using the correct value for padding sequences as input for neural networks is crucial because improper padding can introduce unintended biases and negatively impact model performance. Padding is commonly used when dealing with variable-length sequences in tasks like natural language processing (NLP) and time-series analysis, ensuring that all input sequences have the same length for batch processing. However, if the padding value is not chosen correctly, the model may misinterpret it as meaningful data rather than a placeholder. For example, using a common word (e.g., \"the\" in NLP) as a padding token instead of a distinct padding value can lead to incorrect learning patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, incorrect padding values can affect loss calculation and attention mechanisms in models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and transformers. Many neural networks use masking to ignore padding values during computations, ensuring that padded elements do not contribute to learning. If an improper padding value is used without proper masking, the model might allocate attention to irrelevant padded positions, reducing overall accuracy. Choosing a distinct padding token (e.g., zero for numerical sequences or a special `<PAD>` token for text) and correctly implementing masking techniques help the model focus on meaningful data while avoiding unnecessary computational overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example use case here, we assume that the sequences of word/token indices were created using a vocabulary containing the special token `<PAD>` associated with the index $0$. We therefore *have* to pick $0$ as the padding value now. However, note that there is nothing special about the value $0$. If the index of `<PAD>` in the vocabulary would have been $1455$, then we would have needed to use `padding_value=1455` in the method `pad_sequence()`. It has become a best practice to use $0$ representing the padding token, and that is why we assume the vocabulary the way we do here.\n",

This means we have to be careful that we use [`pad()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.pad.html) correctly to get the expected output. Since our batch has 2 dimensions, we need to specify a 4-tuple to tell the method how to pad our batch tensor. Assuming that `pad_size` is the difference between the desired length and the current length of all sequences, we can do\n",
    "\n",
    "* Left padding: `(pad_size, 0, 0, 0)`\n",
    "* Right padding: `(0, pad_size, 0, 0)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The last two values are always $0$ as they refer to the `batch_size` dimension, which we do not want to change. Run the code cell below to perform either left or right padding."

    "In practice, we don't know ahead of time if we need to truncate or pad a batch. It's therefore convenient to have a method that truncates or pads the sequences of a batch depending on the size of the longest sequence(s). The method `create_fixed_length_batch()` is a simple example implementation; it merely combines the ideas from the code cells above into a single method. Keep in mind that the way sequences of variable lengths should be handled in practice often depends on the nature of the data, the exact task, and the network architecture that is used. So the implementation of method `create_fixed_length_batch()` only illustrates some basic ideas. For example, this method assumes that the `batch_size` dimension is the first dimension; notice the `batch_first=True` parameter in the code below."

    "Now, this representation can be used as inputs for a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The RNN will process each item in all sequences in parallel. Of course, this is possible since all sequences have the same length. However, there are two issues to consider for padded sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The padding token `<PAD>` does not really have any meaning. While we generally can assume that the RNN will \"learn\" that `<PAD>` does not mean anything it potentially still might affect the results, particularly if an initial sequence is very short and a lot of padding was required to adjust the final length.\n",

    "To this end, PyTorch introduces the notion of **packing**. A [`PackedSequence`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.utils.rnn.PackedSequence.html) is a Python object for an internal representation of a tensor with padding. It keeps the true lengths of all sequences (i.e., total length - number of padding indices). Such a [`PackedSequence`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.utils.rnn.PackedSequence.html) object can then be used as input for a RNN layer to tell it when each sequence can be stopped processing. This is all done under the hood, transparent to the user.\n",

    "To create a [`PackedSequence`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.utils.rnn.PackedSequence.html) object, we can use the method [`pack_padded_sequence()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequence.html). Note that without preprocessing of the batch, the method [`pack_padded_sequence()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequence.html) will change the order of the sequences in the batch. This is a problem since then the order of sequences does no longer match the order of our target labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this, the best way is to \"manually\" sort all sequences in a batch from longest to shortest, and rearrange the order of target labels accordingly. The reason is that if the sequences in the batch are sorted from longest to shortest, the method [`pack_padded_sequence()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequence.html) will *not* change order, and both sequences and target labels stay aligned.\n",

    "## Approach 2: Enforcing Equal-Length Batches with a Batch Sampler\n",
    "\n",
    "When using RNNs, compared to CNNs, only the sequences within the same batch have to be of the same length, but two different batches may contain sequences of different lengths. We saw how we can solve this using padding and packing (optional). However, both steps add some overhead in terms of code to write &mdash; with the risk of making mistakes &mdash; and steps to execute. It also does not explicitly address the issue that a batch may contain very short and very long sequences, as inputs are often randomized. While padding and packing still works, having a mix of sequences with very different lengths means that the short sentences need to be padded a lot. Packing ensures that the padding tokens do not affect the training but we still create unnecessarily large tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here is the question: Why do we not only put sequences into the same batch that have the same length to begin with? If all sequences in a batch have the same length, then there is no longer any need for padding and packing. The [data utilities](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html) provided by PyTorch make this surprisingly easy. In more detail, we can implement our own [`BatchSampler`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html) to create only batches that contain sequences of the same length.\n",

    "We first create a simple [`Dataset`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.Dataset). The [`Dataset`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.Dataset) class in the PyTorch library is an abstract base class that provides a standard way to represent datasets. It allows users to define custom datasets by implementing two key methods: `__len__()` to return the number of samples and `__getitem__()` to retrieve a specific data sample and its corresponding label. PyTorch also offers ready-to-use datasets through subclasses like `torchvision.datasets`. This class is useful because it provides flexibility in data handling and preparation. It enables efficient loading and preprocessing of data on-the-fly, making it suitable for large datasets that cannot fit entirely in memory. When combined with the DataLoader class (see below), it supports batch loading, shuffling, and parallel data processing, which are essential for efficient training of neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our new `BaseDataset` class only stores out `inputs` and `targets` and needs to implement the `__len__()` and `__getitem__()` methods. Notice that `targets` maybe `None`. A common example is when working with datasets for training language models, where the targets for the training can directly be derived from the inputs on the fly. Thus, there is no need to store the targets explicitly. Since our class extends the abstract class [`Dataset`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.Dataset), we can use an instance later to create a [`DataLoader`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader). Without going into too much detail, this approach does not only allow for cleaner code but also supports parallel processing on many CPUs, or on the GPU as well as to optimize data transfer between the CPU and GPU, which is critical when processing very large amounts of data. It is therefore the recommended best practice."

Of course, a batch might have less than 5 samples in case there are less than 5 samples with a specific combination of input and target lengths. But again, for large real-world datasets, the likelihood for this to happen is arbitrarily small.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with text, properly handling sequences of different lengths is crucial. While we could avoid any issues with using only batches of size 1, this would sacrifice too much performance in practice when training our models over large/huge datasets. Training neural networks using batches instead of sample by sample is more efficient because it leverages vectorized operations and hardware acceleration, particularly on GPUs. In batch training, multiple samples are processed simultaneously, which allows for matrix multiplications and other operations to be optimized for parallel computation. This significantly speeds up training compared to handling one sample at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, batch training helps stabilize gradient estimates during optimization. Calculating gradients over multiple samples provides a better approximation of the true gradient compared to noisy, individual updates. This balance between computational efficiency and gradient stability makes batch processing both faster and more effective for training deep learning models. So since we aim for a larger batch size, we need to ensure that each batch contains sequences of the same length.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we look into the most common best practices to solve this, particularly when working with CNNs and RNNs. To ensure sequences in a batch have the same length during neural network training, common strategies we have covered include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Padding:** Sequences are extended to match the length of the longest sequence in the batch by adding a special token (e.g., zero) to the shorter sequences. This maintains a consistent input size but requires masking during computation to ignore padded values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Truncation:** Sequences longer than a predefined maximum length are cut off to ensure uniform length, which helps reduce computation time but may lead to information loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Bucketing:** Sequences are grouped into batches of similar or even the same lengths, minimizing the need for excessive padding while maintaining efficient processing. Out custom `EqualLengthsBatchSampler` shows an example for this approach\n",
    "\n",
    "These strategies improve training efficiency and ensure compatibility with models requiring fixed-size inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A closely related topic to padding is **masking**. Masking refers to a technique where the model is explicitly told to ignore padded but also other values during computations, so these these masked elements do not contribute to learning or affect the output. This is important because masked values are not meaningful and should not impact the model's performance. Masking usually involves creating a mask (a binary matrix) that indicates which positions in the sequence are padded (or should otherwise be ignored) and which are actual data points. Neural networks can then use this mask to skip over those values when computing gradients, loss, or attention. Although it solves similar issues like padding, masking is a distinct concept and therefore covered in a separate notebook."
