    "# Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression is a fundamental statistical and machine learning model used to understand and predict relationships between variables. At its core, Linear Regression models the relationship between an independent variable (or variables) and a dependent variable, assuming a linear relationship between them. This simple yet powerful technique helps us make sense of data by identifying patterns and trends, which can be crucial in fields as diverse as economics, biology, engineering, and social sciences. By finding the \"line of best fit\" through a set of data points, Linear Regression allows us to make predictions, providing insight into the dynamics of real-world phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance of Linear Regression lies not only in its simplicity but also in its interpretability. As one of the first algorithms introduced in machine learning courses, Linear Regression is accessible to learners new to data science and is often used as a building block for more advanced models. It allows us to quantify the relationship between variables and measure how changes in one can affect another. For instance, in predicting housing prices, Linear Regression can help model how factors like location, size, and age influence the price of a property. This ease of interpretation makes Linear Regression highly useful in fields where understanding the nature of relationships is as important as making accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, learning Linear Regression is essential because it introduces concepts that are foundational to more complex algorithms, such as regularization techniques, bias-variance tradeoff, and model evaluation metrics. These concepts play a crucial role across machine learning methods, making Linear Regression a natural entry point for these important ideas. While modern machine learning includes advanced techniques such as neural networks and ensemble methods, Linear Regression remains a valuable tool, especially when data is limited or when computational simplicity is desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, Linear Regression is a versatile and interpretable model that provides valuable insights into the relationships between variables. Its broad applications, from predicting economic trends to studying scientific data, make it one of the most widely used and foundational techniques in data analysis and machine learning."

    "\n",
    "Let's assume you want to buy an apartment and are browsing listings on a property website. Each available listing for an apartment has a price. However, assuming you are not expert in the property market, it is not obvious if the listed price is actually a good price (i.e., a bargain) or a bad price (i.e., a rip-off). Of course, you know that apartments typically get more expensive if they are\n",
    "* newer\n",
    "* larger (size of living area)\n",
    "* higher (in case of high-rise buildings)\n",
    "* have more bedrooms / bathrooms\n",
    "* closer to the city center\n",
    "* etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "but it is not really (i.e., quantitatively) clear how those features of an apartment affect its price. For example, is an apartment that has twice the living size of another apartment also twice as expensive on average? Is it more or less than twice as much? Also, just because it is a common assumption, does the distance to the city center really matter that much in reality? Having a good model to describe relationship between the features of apartments and their prices, allows us to address to core task:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Price Prediction:** If we have learned such a model, we can apply it to other apartments for which we do not have its true price to get (hopefully) a good estimate. This good be very useful information for an apartment owner to decide on meaningful asking price when putting the apartment up for sale. In contrast, a buyer can use the model to assess if the asking price for a apartment listing might be a good deal by checking if the asking price is below the predicted estimate or not\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Feature Importance:** Apart from making good predictions, a good model also provides some insights into what the model has learned. One of the most common and useful insights is the importance of features. For example, the model might be able to tell us that the distance to the city center is in fact not an important predictor for the price of an apartment. Seller can use this information to highlight any features in a listing that are more likely to attract buyers, while buyers can assess how much money they can potentially save by focusing on relevant features (e.g., by moving from 3-bedroom to 2-bedroom apartments).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a wide range of such regression models the find such a function or mapping between features and a numerical target outcome. Linear Regression is a model using a linear equation to describe the relationship between, here, the features of apartments and their prices.\n"

    "## Model Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is a statistical model to estimate or describe the relationship between a dependent variable $y$ and one or more independent independent variables $x_1$, $x_2$, ..., $x_n$. The model is *linear* as this relationship between the $y$ and all $x_i$ is  described by the following linear equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large\n",
    "y_i = w_{0} + w_{1}x_{i1} + w_{2}x_{i2} + w_{3}x_{i3} + \\dots + w_{d}x_{id} + e_{i}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $i = 1,..., n$, where\n",
    "\n",
    "* $n$ is the number of observations (i.e., the number of records in our dataset)\n",
    "* $y_i$ is the $i$-th response (e.g., the resale price of an apartment)\n",
    "* $w_k$ is the $k$-th coefficient, with $w_0$ being the constant term in the model called *bias*, *offset*, or *intercept*\n",
    "* $x_{ij}$ is the $j$-th predictor variable (e.g., the size of an apartment, or the floor height) of the $i$-th observation\n",
    "* $e_i$ is the *noise term*, *disturbance term*, or *error variable* of the $i$-th observation\n",
    "\n",
    "The noise terms $e_{i}$ are intrinsic to any real-world data and, of course, random. Therefore, when building a Linear Regression model (e.g., for predicting the $y$ for an new record that was not part of our training data) we have to make the important assumption that the noise terms, on average, cancel out. In mathematical terms we assume that the expectation value for the noise terms $E(e_i) = 0$. That means the the model will typically predict $y$ values (e.g., the price of an apartment) that is too high or too low compared to the true values for the records in the data, but across all training records, those errors cancel out. With this important assumption, we can use a Linear Regression model to calculate the $estimated$ or $predicted$ output $\\hat{h}_{i}$ for the $i$-th data records as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large\n",

    "Before we address the task of finding the best weight values $w_0$, $w_1$, $w_2$, ..., $w_d$, let's first try to make the math a bit easier to work with. For example, we can write our initial equation as follows:\n",

    "Notice how weight $w_0$ kind of \"sticks out\" as it is not associated with any feature value. $w_0$ is called the **bias**, or the **intercept**, or the **offset**. The bias term is essential because it allows the model to accurately represent the relationship between input features and the target variable. Without a bias term, the regression line would be forced to pass through the origin, meaning that when all features are zero, the target prediction would also be zero. This assumption is often unrealistic, as the relationship between features and the target variable rarely aligns with the origin, especially in complex datasets. The bias term enables the model to shift vertically, giving it more flexibility to fit the data accurately. Of course, for our motivating example using apartment prices this might not be as relevant since an apartment where all feature values are 0 (e.g., incl its size) is not meaningful.\n",

The scenario is a Crime Scene Investigation: Let's assume we are called to a crime and found the shoe print the suspect. However, the shoe print size is generally not a very useful information to look for suspects or ask the public for hints. Much more common is to publicize the height of a person. Now, arguably taller people have also taller feet and therefore wear larger shoes, and is not unreasonable to assume a linear relationship between a persons height and his or her shoe size. So how can we find a good estimate of the suspect's height given the shoe print we found?\n",

In some sense, it is the simplest setup since we have only a single independent variable (i.e., the shoe print size); the dependent variable is, of course, the height of the person.

Keep in mind that, in general, $\\mathbf{x}_i = (x_{i1}, x_{i2}, ..., x_{id})$, that is, each record has $d$ features (i.e., independent variables).

In general, training or fitting a parametric model is treated as an optimization problem. For Linear Regression, as well as for many other machine learning models, this optimization refers to minimizing or maximizing some function. In case of a loss functions such as the MSE loss, we want to find the parameters &mdash; here: $\\mathbf{w}$ &mdash; that minimize that function.\n",

This means we still need to determine if we indeed found a minimum (and not a maximum or saddle point). This is done by calculating the 2nd partial derivatives of function $f$ and check if their values at the point of the extreme value is positive, negative, or zero. However, in the context of training parametric models such as Linear Regression, this last check is generally not required since we \"know\" that our extreme value must be a minimum.

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression is one of the simplest and most widely used techniques in statistics and machine learning. It models the relationship between one or more independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target) by fitting a linear equation to the data. The goal is to find the best-fitting line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that minimizes the error between predicted and actual values. This error is often measured using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression can be categorized into two types: Simple Linear Regression (with one independent variable) and Multiple Linear Regression (with multiple independent variables). The model assumes a linear relationship between the variables. Despite its simplicity, it is highly interpretable and can serve as a powerful baseline for regression problems in various fields, including finance, healthcare, and marketing. For data scientists, AI engineers, and machine learning students, understanding linear regression is critical because it provides the foundational principles behind more complex machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world applications, linear regression is not only used as a predictive tool but also for its interpretability. For example, it helps determine the strength and significance of relationships between variables, enabling actionable insights. This makes it invaluable in domains like economics and healthcare, where understanding the impact of individual variables is as important as making accurate predictions. Learning about linear regression also prepares students and professionals to understand advanced techniques, including polynomial regression, logistic regression, and generalized linear models. It serves as a stepping stone for mastering more sophisticated algorithms like neural networks, which often involve nonlinear transformations but retain similar optimization principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, linear regression is fundamental to data science and machine learning. Its simplicity, interpretability, and utility across disciplines make it an essential topic for anyone aiming to build a strong foundation in these fields. By mastering linear regression, practitioners can better understand data, evaluate relationships, and prepare for more advanced modeling techniques."
