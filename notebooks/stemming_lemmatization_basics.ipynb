    "# Stemming & Lemmatization\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following to sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *\"Dogs make the best friends.\"*\n",
    "* *\"A dog makes a good friend.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantically, both sentences are essentially conveying the same message, but syntactically they are very different since the vocabulary is different: \"dog\" vs. \"dog\", \"make\" vs. \"makes\", \"friends\" vs. \"friend\". This is a big problem when comparing documents or when searching for documents in a database. For example, when one uses \"dog\" as a search term, both sentences should be returned and not just the second one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming and lemmatization are two common techniques used in natural language processing (NLP) for text normalization. Both methods aim to reduce words to their base or root forms, but they differ in their approaches and outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stemming:** Stemming is a process of reducing words to their \"stems\" by removing prefixes and suffixes, typically through simple heuristic rules. The resulting stems may not always be actual words. The goal of stemming is to normalize words that have the same base meaning but may have different inflections or variations. For example, stemming the words \"running,\" \"runs,\" and \"runner\" would result in the common stem \"run.\" A popular stemming algorithm is the Porter stemming algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lemmatization:** Lemmatization, on the other hand, is a more advanced technique that aims to transform words to their \"lemmas,\" which are the base or dictionary forms of words. Lemmatization takes into account the morphological analysis of words and considers factors such as part-of-speech (POS) tags to determine the correct lemma. The output of lemmatization is usually a real word that exists in the language. For example, lemmatizing the words \"running,\" \"runs,\" and \"runner\" would yield the lemma \"run.\" Lemmatization requires more linguistic knowledge and often relies on dictionaries or language-specific resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between stemming and lemmatization depends on the specific NLP task and its requirements. Stemming is a simpler and faster technique, often used when the exact word form is not critical, such as in information retrieval or indexing tasks. Lemmatization, being more linguistically sophisticated, is preferred in tasks where the base form and the semantic meaning of words are important, such as in machine translation, sentiment analysis, or question-answering systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that stemming and lemmatization may not always produce the same results, and the choice between them should consider the trade-offs between accuracy and computational complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both stemming and lemmatization are the methods to normalize documents on a syntactical level. Often the same words are used in different forms depending on their grammatical use in a sentence."

    "## Stemming\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming is a process in natural language processing (NLP) that reduces words to their base or root forms, called stems. Stemming algorithms apply heuristic rules to remove prefixes and suffixes from words, aiming to normalize variations of words that share a common root. There are several popular stemming algorithms, each with its own approach and characteristics. The main differences between different stemmers include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Porter Stemmer:** The Porter stemming algorithm, developed by Martin Porter, is one of the most widely used stemmers. It applies a series of rules and transformations to remove common English word endings, focusing on the structure of the word rather than its linguistic meaning. The Porter stemmer is known for its simplicity and speed but may produce stems that are not actual words.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Snowball Stemmer:** The Snowball stemmer, also known as the Porter2 stemmer, is an extension of the Porter stemmer. It provides stemmers for multiple languages, including English, German, Spanish, French, and more. The Snowball stemmer is an improvement over the original Porter stemmer, addressing some of its limitations and offering better performance and accuracy for different languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lancaster Stemmer:** The Lancaster stemming algorithm, developed by Chris D. Paice, is an aggressive stemming algorithm that focuses on removing prefixes and suffixes from words. It applies a set of rules that are more aggressive than those used in the Porter stemmer, often resulting in shorter stems. The Lancaster stemmer is known for its aggressive stemming behavior and can produce stems that are not recognizable as actual words.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lovins Stemmer:** The Lovins stemmer, developed by J. H. Lovins, is an early stemming algorithm that uses a set of rules based on linguistic principles to remove common word endings. It aims to produce stems that are linguistically meaningful and recognizable as real words. The Lovins stemmer is not as widely used as the Porter or Lancaster stemmers but can be useful in certain contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of stemmer depends on the specific NLP task, the language being processed, and the trade-offs between simplicity, speed, accuracy, and the desired level of stemming aggressiveness. It's important to evaluate and compare the performance of different stemmers for a particular application to determine the most suitable one.\n",

    "## Lemmatization\n",
    "\n",
    "A lemmatizer is a tool or algorithm that transforms words into their base or dictionary forms, known as lemmas. Unlike stemming, which simplifies words by removing prefixes and suffixes without considering linguistic context, lemmatization takes into account the morphological analysis of words, part-of-speech (POS) tags, and language-specific rules to produce meaningful and valid lemmas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a brief summary of how a lemmatizer for NLP typically works:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tokenization:** The text is divided into individual words or tokens using tokenization techniques. This is typically a separate step performed before lemmatization; but the lemmatizer assumes tokenized text as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **POS tagging:** Each word is assigned a part-of-speech tag, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. POS tagging helps determine the appropriate lemma based on the word's grammatical role.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lemmatization rules:** The lemmatizer applies language-specific rules and patterns to convert words to their lemmas. These rules consider factors like a word's POS tag, its inflections, and other linguistic properties. For example, for English verbs, the lemmatizer would handle verb conjugations to identify the base form.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lookup in dictionary or lexicon:** The lemmatizer may consult a dictionary or lexicon that contains information about word forms and their corresponding lemmas. This can be helpful for irregular words that don't follow regular morphological rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lemmatization output:** The lemmatizer generates the lemma for each word, which represents the base or canonical form of the word. The resulting lemmas are typically real words that exist in the language and are recognized by native speakers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Post-processing:** In some cases, additional post-processing steps may be applied to refine or improve the lemmatization results. These steps could include handling special cases, resolving ambiguities, or dealing with out-of-vocabulary terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: Both tokenization and POS tagging are their own topics and their detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this notebook. Therefore, in the following use the toy example that are already tokenized and POS tagged, or use existing libraries and methods to perform these two tasks.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lemmatization requires linguistic knowledge, language-specific resources (such as dictionaries or lexicons), and morphological analysis to accurately identify and generate the appropriate lemmas. It is a more sophisticated technique compared to stemming and is generally preferred when preserving the semantic meaning and grammatical correctness of words is crucial in NLP tasks like machine translation, information retrieval, or sentiment analysis."

    "### Building a Simple Lemmatizer\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, most lemmatizers rely on dictionaries and lexicons to look up the lemma of a word given its POS tag. This means that the main effort of building a basic lemmatizer is often creating and curating such dictionaries and lexicons. For resource-rich languages such as English this can be rather straightforward. A resource-rich language is one that has extensive computational and linguistic resources readily available to support natural language processing tasks. These resources include large datasets, annotated corpora, dictionaries, and language models, as well as software tools and frameworks tailored for the language.\n",

    "Of course, you can probably already spot a problem. If our dictionary does not contain a word, or the word-level dictionary does not contain the given POS tag, trying to get the lemma of a word will fail and raise an error. In practice, this can be a common case since such dictionaries are never guaranteed to be complete. For one, language is constantly evolving, with new words being added. But more commonly, such dictionaries generally cover named entities, that is, the names of persons, organizations, companies, locations, and so on. Such names are not expected to be lemmatized anyway. This also includes any non-word tokens such as numbers, abbreviations, punctuation marks, URLs, etc.\n",

    "In short, assuming the availability of a suitable dictionary or lexicon, implementing a basic lemmatizer is reasonably straightforward. Of course, more sophisticated lemmatizers will go beyond simple dictionary lookups. For example, a lemmatizer may analyze the morphology of words, i.e., its structure by considering prefixes and suffixes. Some modern lemmatizers use machine learning models trained on large corpora to predict lemmas. These models can account for patterns that might not be explicitly codified. They can adapt to new words or usages that may not yet exist in dictionaries. Advanced lemmatizers, especially those based on neural networks, analyze the entire sentence to determine the most appropriate lemma for a word. This is crucial for handling polysemous words (words with multiple meanings). Beyond standard dictionary entries, lemmatizers may handle non-standard words such as contractions, abbreviations, slang, and misspellings by mapping them to their canonical forms. By combining these techniques, a lemmatizer provides a more nuanced and accurate output than a simple dictionary lookup, especially in complex or ambiguous linguistic contexts."

NLTK is widely used for various NLP tasks, including lemmatization, and the WordNetLemmatizer is one of the lemmatization options it offers. It is specifically designed to lemmatize English words based on WordNet, a lexical database for English. WordNet organizes words into synsets (sets of synonyms), and each synset is linked to various lemmas representing different word forms. The `WordNetLemmatizer` in NLTK utilizes WordNet's information and applies lemmatization rules to transform words to their lemmas. It takes into account the part-of-speech (POS) tag of each word and provides options for lemmatizing nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming and lemmatization are essential techniques in natural language processing (NLP) that help normalize and reduce words to their base forms. Here is a brief summary of their uses and importance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stemming:**\n",
    "    * Uses: Stemming is primarily employed in tasks where the exact word form is not crucial, such as information retrieval, indexing, and search engines.\n",
    "    * Importance: Stemming allows for the reduction of words to their common base form, which helps in matching variations of words, handling inflections, and improving recall in search queries. It reduces the vocabulary size and can enhance computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lemmatization:**\n",
    "    * Uses: Lemmatization is useful in NLP tasks where preserving the semantic meaning and grammatical correctness of words is important, such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, question-answering systems, and language generation.\n",
    "    * Importance: Lemmatization provides the base or canonical form of words, capturing their underlying meaning. It helps in resolving word variants, handling different inflections, and maintaining the integrity of the language structure. Lemmatization enables better accuracy and precision in language understanding and generation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Overall Importance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * *Vocabulary Normalization:* Stemming and lemmatization help reduce the dimensionality of text data by grouping words with similar meanings. They assist in avoiding redundancy and noise in the data, leading to better generalization and improved performance in NLP models.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * *Language Understanding:* By reducing words to their base forms, stemming and lemmatization enhance the ability of NLP systems to understand and process text. They facilitate tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing, and semantic analysis by providing consistent representations of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "     * *Information Retrieval:* Stemming and lemmatization contribute to more effective information retrieval by matching user queries with relevant documents. They improve recall by accounting for different word forms and variations, enabling a broader range of matching possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * *Text Analysis and Mining:* Stemming and lemmatization aid in analyzing and mining large text corpora by simplifying and standardizing word representations. They assist in extracting meaningful patterns, identifying recurring themes, and gaining insights from textual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the appropriate technique (stemming or lemmatization) depends on the specific NLP task, language, and trade-offs between precision, recall, and computational complexity. It is crucial to evaluate and experiment with both techniques to ensure optimal performance and accurate language processing in various NLP applications."
