    "# LoRA Fine-Tuning &mdash; A Basic Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) has become a key technique for adapting powerful pretrained models to specific tasks and domains. While models like GPT, LLaMA, and TinyLlama are trained on massive amounts of general-purpose data, they may not always produce the most accurate or contextually relevant outputs for specialized use cases. Fine-tuning allows us to take advantage of the vast knowledge encoded in these pretrained models while tailoring them to the language style, constraints, and requirements of our own dataset. This balance between leveraging pretrained knowledge and adding task-specific adaptation makes fine-tuning both efficient and effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another major benefit of fine-tuning is **resource efficiency**. Training an LLM from scratch requires enormous amounts of compute, data, and time &mdash; something that is often impractical outside large research labs. Fine-tuning, however, allows practitioners to update only a fraction of the model’s parameters (sometimes using techniques like **LoRA** or other parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods), making it possible to adapt billion-parameter models on consumer hardware or cloud GPUs at a fraction of the cost. This democratizes the ability to customize state-of-the-art models for industry, research, and individual projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will walk step by step through the process of fine-tuning a pretrained LLM using Hugging Face’s `transformers`, `datasets`, and `peft` libraries. We will start by preparing our dataset, formatting it into a role-based chat style suitable for dialogue models, and applying tokenization. From there, we will explore how to set up data collators to handle variable-length sequences, ensuring our batches are efficiently padded for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then move on to configuring parameter-efficient fine-tuning with **LoRA**, explaining why adapting just a small subset of the model's weights can achieve strong performance improvements while dramatically reducing compute requirements. Finally, we will set up Hugging Face's **Trainer** with the appropriate training arguments, launch the training process, and discuss how to monitor progress and evaluate results. By the end of the notebook, you will have a clear, reproducible workflow for adapting any Hugging Face-compatible LLM to your own task or dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hands-on approach is designed to not only provide working code but also to deepen your understanding of the key concepts and tools involved in fine-tuning. Whether your goal is to build a chatbot, perform domain-specific text generation, or experiment with custom data, this notebook will give you the foundation you need to effectively harness the power of modern LLMs."

    "## Overview & Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning pretrained models is very popular because it saves a lot of time and resources. Training a large language model (LLM) or a vision model from scratch requires huge amounts of data, computing power, and money. Instead of starting from zero, you can take a model that has already been trained on massive datasets and adjust it for their own specific needs. This way, you can benefit from the model's general knowledge while making it more useful for their task. There are many reasons for fine-tuning models. One common reason is to make the model better at a particular task, such as answering questions in a specific domain (like medicine or law). Another reason is to improve performance on a target dataset, which may have a slightly different distribution than the data the original model was trained on. \n",
    "\n",
    "An especially popular use case is fine-tuning a **model's style**. For example, a chatbot may be fine-tuned to sound more friendly, professional, or casual depending on the target audience. This kind of style adaptation is usually easier than teaching the model completely new facts. The reason is that style adjustments mostly involve changing how the model expresses itself, not what it knows. Since the base model already has strong language skills, fine-tuning just shifts its tone or phrasing. In contrast, incorporating **new facts** into a pretrained model is much harder. If you want the model to \"learn\" updated knowledge &mdash; such as new scientific discoveries or the latest sports results &mdash; fine-tuning is often not enough, because the model's training is not designed to handle small factual updates. This is why methods like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or external knowledge bases are often better for keeping models factually up to date.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we therefore fine-tune a pretrained model to adapt a model's style. More specifically, our goal is to build a chatbot that is used by kids to answer their questions. While typical pretrained LLMs answer correctly, their replies are written in a very neutral style. For our chatbot, however, we want to answer using simple language but are also motivating and encouraging so that kids may have more fun and be more eager to ask more questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this goal in mind, let's get started!"

    "Fine-tuning begins with a pretrained model. In this notebook we will be using `TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0`,  a lightweight, open-source large language model trained with about 1.1 billion parameters. It is part of the TinyLlama project, which aims to provide compact models that maintain strong performance while being much more efficient than larger LLMs like `LLaMA-7B` or `GPT-style` models. TinyLlama was pretrained on a large-scale corpus following the LLaMA training recipe, giving it a solid foundation in general language understanding and generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chat-v1.0 version is specifically fine-tuned for dialogue, making it better suited for conversational tasks like answering questions, providing explanations, or role-based interactions &mdash; thus, matching our goal of building a child-friendly chatbot. Because of its small size, it is much easier to run on consumer hardware (such as a single GPU or even high-end laptops) while still delivering reasonable accuracy and coherence in responses. It is especially useful in scenarios where resource efficiency, faster inference, or deployment on edge devices matters.\n",

    "\n",
    "Apart from the pretrained model itself, we also need to load the \"matching\" tokenizer. Each pretrained model typically comes with its own tokenizer because the tokenizer defines how raw text is split into tokens that map to the model's vocabulary. During pretraining, the model learns statistical patterns over a very specific tokenization scheme &mdash; whether that is **byte pair encoding (BPE)**, **SentencePiece**, **WordPiece**, or another method. The model's embeddings and internal representations are tied directly to the vocabulary produced by that tokenizer. If you were to use a different tokenizer, the token IDs would not match the learned embeddings, and the model's outputs would become meaningless. Bundling the tokenizer with the pretrained model ensures **consistency and compatibility**.\n",

The `AutoTokenizer` class in the `transformers` library is the high-level API for loading the right tokenizer associated with a given pretrained model.

This is needed for most CLMs which were trained without a dedicated padding token (incl. our TinyLllama model), since they typically process continuous text streams rather than batches with variable lengths. However, when you want to fine-tune or batch inputs together for efficiency, you often need a padding token so that shorter sequences can be padded to match the longest one in the batch. If the tokenizer has no `pad_token` defined, code that expects one &mdash; and we will see an example for that later &mdash; will raise an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the EOS token as the padding token is a practical workaround: the model already knows how to handle EOS during training, and reusing it for padding avoids introducing an *unknown token* that the model was not trained on. This way, padding will not disrupt training or inference, though it is not always semantically perfect. Of course, if a model was trained with a dedicated padding token as part of its vocabulary, then this same token should be used instead."

Many models, including chat versions of LLaMA or TinyLlama, were fine-tuned on **instruction-response datasets** where each prompt is wrapped in a consistent template, often including system instructions, user messages, and assistant response markers. The method takes your raw input and inserts it into this template so that the model receives text in the exact format it was trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is important because **pretrained chat models are highly sensitive to prompt structure**. If you feed the model raw text without the template, it may fail to recognize where the user's input ends and where the model should start generating a response, leading to incomplete, irrelevant, or garbled outputs. Luckily, `AutoTokenizer` class provides the auxiliary method `apply_chat_template()` to convert a raw input into the correct template.

In our case, we need a dataset contain different questions together with their answer in a style and form we are aiming for: child-friendly, motivating, encouraging. To this end, we have generated a small dataset with suitable question-answer pairs. The set of questions is taken from a [publicly available dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ilyaryabov/general-knowledge-qa). However, we only kept proper Wh-questions (what, when, where, who, whom, which, whose, why...and how); for example, this includes that we have removed True/False questions from the list. This left with 550 questions.\n",

    "To generate the answers, we used the OpenAI API and the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model to answer each question using the following `system` role: *\"You are a helpful online tutor for kids. Be encouraging and motivating. Reply using simple language that is easy to understand for kids. The response should not end with a follow-up question.\"*. While convenient, this LLM-driven approach of generating data sets risk the phenomenon of  **data inbreeding** where models are trained repeatedly on outputs generated by other models rather than on fresh, high-quality human-created data. Over time, this feedback loop causes the training data to become less diverse, less accurate, and more biased &mdash; similar to genetic inbreeding in biology. However, this notebook focuses on the basic steps required to fine-tune a model; the goal is not a production-ready model to be used for a chatbot."

Each column corresponds to a feature (like text, labels, or IDs), and each row corresponds to a single data example. The class is optimized for efficient storage, fast slicing, and integration with machine learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, making it ideal for preparing and serving large-scale training and evaluation datasets. The **`from_list()`** method is a convenience constructor that allows you to quickly build a `Dataset` object directly from a Python list of dictionaries or objects. Each item in the list represents a row (or example), and the method infers the schema of the dataset from the keys and types of the provided data. This is particularly useful when you have in-memory data (e.g., after preprocessing or generating synthetic examples) and want to convert it into a `Dataset` that supports the library’s powerful features like mapping, shuffling, and batching."

To enable batch processing for batch sizes larger than $1$ for improved efficiency, we have to ensure that all inputs within the same batch have the same length. The default method to do this is **padding** &mdash; extending all shorter inputs in the batch by adding padding tokens. While we could perform padding manually, there is a much easier way to do this.\n",

A data collator is responsible for batching together individual samples into tensors that can be fed to the model. Since text sequences often have different lengths, `DataCollatorForSeq2Seq` dynamically pads each batch to the length of the longest sequence within that batch rather than padding all sequences to a fixed maximum length. This makes training more memory-efficient and faster, as the model does not waste computation on unnecessary padding.

By default, the collator produces batches as PyTorch tensors (`\"pt\"`), but you can also specify `\"tf\"` for TensorFlow tensors, `\"np\"` for NumPy arrays, or `\"jax\"` for JAX/Flax arrays. This argument is important because the `Trainer` class (see below) expects the inputs to be in the correct tensor format for the underlying deep learning framework you are using.

    "**Side note:** The `transformer` library also provides a `DataCollatorForLanguageModeling` class which seems the intuitive choice for our use case. However, when fine-tuning a pretrained model for chat-style conversations, `DataCollatorForSeq2Seq` offers advantages over `DataCollatorForLanguageModeling` primarily in how it handles padding and labels. `DataCollatorForSeq2Seq` automatically sets padded positions in the labels to `-100`, so the model ignores them during loss computation. This is particularly beneficial for chat-style fine-tuning because sequences often vary greatly in length across turns, and dynamic padding ensures efficient batching without introducing spurious gradients from padding tokens. In contrast, `DataCollatorForLanguageModeling` pads only the input and treats all tokens equally in the loss, which can dilute learning on the assistant's responses. Overall, `DataCollatorForSeq2Seq` provides more precise control over what the model learns and how sequences are padded, improving training efficiency and chat-response quality."

    "## Fine-Tuning with LoRA\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of fine-tuning the whole model &mdash; and therefore changing its original weights &mdash; we use [**Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA)**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) in this notebook. LoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) technique which &mdash; instead of updating all of a model's parameters &mdash; inserts small trainable matrices (low-rank decompositions) into certain weight layers, typically the attention or feedforward layers. During training, only these low-rank matrices are updated, while the original model weights remain frozen. This drastically reduces the number of trainable parameters, making fine-tuning faster, less memory-intensive, and more storage-efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more detail. Instead of updating the a layer's full weight matrix $\\mathbf{W}^{m\\times n}$ (which can be very large), LoRA learns two much smaller matrices $\\mathbf{A}^{m\\times r}$ and $\\mathbf{B}^{r\\times n}$ whose product approximates the necessary update $\\Delta \\mathbf{W} = \\mathbf{AB}$, which then yields the final output of the layer $\\mathbf{h} = \\mathbf{W} + \\Delta\\mathbf{W}$. The matrices $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ have dimensions chosen so that the rank $r$ is much smaller than the original matrix size, drastically reducing the number of trainable parameters. The figure below illustrates the idea of LoRA."

It specifies key hyperparameters such as the rank (`r`, the size of the low-rank matrices), the scaling factor (`alpha`), which modules of the model should be adapted (e.g., attention layers), whether dropout is applied, and the task type (e.g., causal LM, seq2seq LM, classification).

    "In many transformer architectures, especially LLaMA, GPT-style, and related models, setting `target_modules=[\"q_proj\", \"v_proj\"]` in LoRA fine-tuning is common because the query (`q_proj`) and value (`v_proj`) projection matrices inside the attention mechanism are the most influential for controlling how tokens attend to each other. By adapting only these two, LoRA can significantly alter a model's reasoning and generation patterns while touching far fewer parameters than adapting all projections (query, key, value, output). Empirically, researchers found that modifying `q_proj` and `v_proj` often captures most of the benefit of full fine-tuning, offering a sweet spot between efficiency and effectiveness. That said, this is not a strict rule &mdash; sometimes `k_proj`, `o_proj`, or even feedforward layers are targeted too, depending on the model and task. But `q_proj` + `v_proj` has become the default choice because it consistently gives strong results with minimal extra overhead."

The method wraps your model with PEFT logic: it freezes the original weights, replaces the chosen layers with parameter-efficient alternatives, and keeps track of which parameters should be updated during training.

    "Even with one or more trained adapters attached to the pretrained model, we can still generate responses by using only the pretrained model. The `disable_adapter()` method temporarily turns off the active adapter so that the model behaves as if no adapter were applied. In practice, this means only the base pretrained model's parameters are used during the forward pass, while the adapter layers (e.g., LoRA) are skipped. This is useful when you want to compare the performance of the base model versus the fine-tuned adapter, or when you need to run inference without the adapter's influence. Later, you can re-enable a specific adapter using `set_adapter()` without having to reload anything from disk.\n",

    "As we just have seen, separating the pretrained model and the trained adapters can be very convenient. However, at some point &mdash; for example, when you are happy with the behavior of the fine-tuned model &mdash; you may want to combine both the pretrained model and the currently active adapter into a single model. Again, the `PeftModel` class makes this very easy. The `merge_and_unload()` method takes the adapter parameters (e.g., LoRA weight updates) and merges them directly into the base model's weights. After this operation, the model no longer depends on the adapter layers, and you get a standalone model with the fine-tuning baked into its parameters. This is useful when you want to export or deploy the model without carrying around separate adapter configurations. It simplifies inference and reduces overhead since the adapter logic is removed, but it also makes the model larger (because you are now saving the full set of modified base model weights rather than just the lightweight adapter)."

    "### Scaling Up\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to provide a tutorial with no ambition towards state-of-the-art results. As such, we used a small pretrained model to keep the memory requirements low. Although the TinyLlama model we used with its 1.1 Billion parameters performs surprisingly well, (much) larger models typically show a much better accuracy and quality, unsurprisingly. Instead of fine-tuning the complete model, we use LoRA as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method to further save memory. We saw that our LoRA adapter only added 0.1% of additional weights to the original model. However, it would be wrong to assume that fine-tuning with LoRA is cheap in memory because \"we only train the adapter weights\". While this is partly true, the actual memory requirements are larger because of how training works. The actual amount of memory required is determined by several factors, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The pretrained model still needs to be loaded:** Even if you freeze the original model’s parameters, the full set of pretrained weights must still be in memory. The LoRA adapters only add a small number of new parameters, but they *sit on top of* the original model. So your GPU must hold the base model weights plus the adapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Activations during training take space:** During fine-tuning, the forward pass produces activations (intermediate outputs from each layer). These activations are needed for the backward pass to compute gradients. The size of activations depends on the model architecture, input length, and batch size—not just on LoRA’s small adapter weights. This is often the biggest contributor to memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Gradients and optimizer states:** Even though the frozen model parameters do not require gradients, the LoRA adapter weights do. That means you need to store the gradients for the adapter weights, as well as the optimizer states (e.g., momentum, variance in Adam optimizer), which can be 2-3 times the size of the trainable parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Mixed-precision and checkpointing effects:** If you use mixed-precision (FP16/BF16), the model may still keep some weights in higher precision (FP32) for stability. Also, gradient checkpointing can save memory but requires recomputation, which trades memory for compute. These factors add complexity beyond just adapter size.\n",
    "\n",
    "So while LoRA saves memory by reducing the number of *trainable parameters*, the training still requires storing the full base model weights, intermediate activations, gradients, and optimizer states. That is why memory use depends on much more than just the adapter weights."

    "Beside the small pretrained model, we also only used a rather small dataset for training the LoRA adapter. And not only was the dataset small, we also generated the answer to the questions using a large LLM (via the OpenAI API). In practice, creating a good fine-tuning dataset to adapt the **tone or style** of a pretrained LLM is surprisingly challenging, even though it might seem \"just about words\". The difficulty comes from several practical and conceptual reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Subjectivity of style and tone:** Unlike factual tasks (e.g., answering questions correctly), style is subjective. What feels \"friendly\" or \"professional\" can vary between people, cultures, or contexts. This makes it hard to define strict rules for your dataset. If your dataset is inconsistent, the model may learn a mixed or unstable style.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Need for high-quality, consistent examples:** Fine-tuning works best when examples are clean, clear, and consistent. For style adaptation, this means you need many paired examples showing the *same content expressed in the target style*. Collecting such examples at scale is labor-intensive. Unlike factual datasets (which can sometimes be scraped or generated automatically), style-focused datasets often require human curation and careful editing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Coverage across scenarios:** A good style-adaptation dataset must cover diverse topics, prompts, and contexts. For example, if you want a \"casual\" style, the model should respond casually whether the prompt is a technical question, a joke, or a personal story. If the dataset is too narrow, the model may only apply the style correctly in specific situations and fail elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Balancing style with meaning:** It is easy for style adaptation to accidentally change the content or introduce bias. For instance, rewriting text to sound \"funny\" or \"emotional\" may distort factual information. Ensuring that the model keeps the original meaning while changing only the tone requires careful dataset design and often multiple rounds of review.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data scarcity for specific or rare styles:** Some styles are uncommon or hard to find in publicly available text. For example, a very formal, legalistic style or the voice of a specific author might not exist in large corpora. In such cases, you either have to manually create examples or use synthetic generation, which may introduce noise or artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adapting tone or style requires a dataset that is high-quality, consistent, diverse, and representative, which is much harder to collect and define than datasets for factual tasks. The subjectivity of style, the risk of content distortion, and the need for broad coverage make style adaptation a non-trivial challenge. This includes that creating such a dataset with the help of large(er) LLMs as we did for our example dataset can be problematic in practice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using large LLMs to create a dataset for style or tone adaptation might seem convenient, but it comes with notable risks. First, the model may **introduce biases or inconsistencies** in the generated examples. Since the LLM reflects patterns from its training data, it might exaggerate certain expressions, adopt unintended tones, or produce outputs that are subtly influenced by stereotypes or unwanted stylistic quirks. This can make the resulting dataset less reliable for training a model to produce a consistent, controlled style. Second, relying on an LLM to generate style-specific examples can lead to **data drift or overfitting to the model's own \"voice\"**. This can reduce diversity and limit the model's ability to generalize to real-world prompts. In other words, you risk creating a dataset that is convenient but not fully representative or high-quality for teaching nuanced stylistic behavior."

    "We evaluated the effect of our fine-tuning approach simply bey comparing the responses for 5 example questions. While the result generalled \"looked good\", are more systematic evaluation is required. Evaluating a fine-tuned model for **style adaptation** is different from evaluating it for accuracy or factual correctness. Since the goal is not whether the model gives the *right* answer, but whether it communicates in the *intended way*, you need a systematic process that combines both **quantitative** and **qualitative** methods, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Define the target style clearly:** Before evaluation, you should spell out what the target style means. For example, if you want a “friendly” style, describe it with concrete features: shorter sentences, use of casual words, more emojis, or softer tone. For a “professional” style, you might expect formal vocabulary, no slang, and polite phrasing. These style rules form the evaluation baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Create a test set with varied prompts:** Prepare a fixed set of prompts covering different scenarios &mdash; questions, requests, and edge cases. The prompts should be diverse enough to show whether the style is applied consistently. This ensures that the evaluation does not depend on just a few cherry-picked examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Automatic metrics (quantitative check):** You can use natural language processing (NLP) tools to measure some style aspects such as readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid to quantify sentence complexity, lexical features (e.g., average sentence length, word choice frequency, sentiment polarity), or style classifiers (e.g., a pretrained model trained to recognize tone). These give objective signals about whether the outputs match the intended style.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Human evaluation (qualitative check):** Since style is subjective, human judges are essential. Ask multiple evaluators to rate model outputs on criteria like style alignment (Does it match the intended tone?), consistency (Is the style applied across all responses?), appropriateness (Is the style suitable for the situation?). For example, you can use Likert scales (1–5) for ratings to make results measurable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, a proper evaluation of a fine-tuned model &mdash; particularly when we want to measure subjective results such as different styles/tones &mdash; can be quite challenging and involves many steps. However, these efforts are beyond the scope of this notebook which focuses on the basic steps required for fine-tuning pretrained models."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a **basic tutorial on fine-tuning a pretrained model for style adaptation** using Hugging Face libraries. Its primary goal is to introduce the key steps in the process, giving readers a hands-on understanding of how a model’s tone or style can be adjusted. The tutorial walks through tasks such as loading a pretrained model and tokenizer, preparing a dataset with examples in the target style, setting up the training loop or Trainer API, and applying evaluation methods to check style alignment. The emphasis is on clarity and simplicity, making it accessible even for those new to model fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook highlights that fine-tuning for style is different from fine-tuning for factual tasks. Rather than teaching the model new knowledge, the goal is to **modify the way it expresses existing knowledge**, such as changing tone, formality, or writing style. Example prompts and target outputs demonstrate how small adjustments in the training data can influence the model’s responses. This hands-on approach helps users grasp the concept that style adaptation largely relies on carefully curated examples rather than simply increasing dataset size.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the tutorial focuses on the **basic steps**, it also notes that fine-tuning models in practice can be much more complex. Creating high-quality style datasets is challenging because style is subjective, and maintaining consistency across diverse prompts is difficult. Additionally, managing memory usage, batch sizes, and hyperparameters becomes important when scaling to larger models, and the notebook briefly introduces these considerations without delving into advanced techniques. The notebook also touches on evaluation strategies, showing both **automatic metrics** (like sentiment or formality classifiers) and **human assessment** methods. These help users verify whether the model is successfully adapting its style while still preserving the intended meaning of responses. By combining these approaches, the tutorial gives a foundational understanding of style fine-tuning without assuming prior deep knowledge of model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the notebook serves as a starting point for experimenting with style adaptation, providing a **practical, step-by-step introduction**. It encourages users to explore and iterate while also acknowledging the real-world challenges involved in fine-tuning large language models, preparing them for more advanced projects in the future."
