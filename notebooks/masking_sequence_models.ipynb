    "# Masking in Sequence Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Masking is a vital technique in sequence models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers, where the input data often comes in the form of ordered sequences such as text, audio, or time-series signals. These models are designed to process and learn from sequential data, but in real-world scenarios, sequences frequently vary in length or contain missing, irrelevant, or future data points that should not influence the model's predictions. Masking provides a mechanism to control the flow of information within the model, ensuring that only valid and appropriate parts of the input are used during training and inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the primary reasons for the necessity of masking stems from the inherent nature of sequential data, such as text or time series. When training models on sentences of varying lengths, for instance, **padding** is often introduced to create uniform input sizes for batch processing. Masking becomes indispensable here to differentiate between actual data and the artificial padding, ensuring that the model doesn't process or learn from these meaningless padded tokens. Beyond handling variable lengths, masking is also vital for tasks like **self-supervised learning**, where parts of the input are intentionally masked and the model is trained to predict the hidden portions. This forces the model to learn contextual relationships and deeper understandings of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, masking techniques are critical for **preventing information leakage** and enabling more effective training paradigms. In NLP, for example, the concept of \"attention masks\" is widely used in Transformer architectures. These masks prevent the attention mechanism from attending to future tokens during training for tasks like language modeling, simulating a more realistic inference scenario where future information is unavailable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding and correctly implementing masking is essential for anyone working with sequence models. Improper masking can lead to information leakage, skewed training signals, or suboptimal attention behavior. As models like Transformers continue to dominate fields such as NLP and even expand into vision and multimodal tasks, mastering the use of masking is increasingly important. It ensures that models learn from data in a structured, meaningful way, preserving the temporal and logical integrity of the sequence data they are designed to process."

    "## Loss Masking\n",
    "\n",
    "Loss masking is a technique used in machine learning, especially in models that process sequences like text, to control which parts of the output contribute to the training loss. When a model makes predictions over a sequence &mdash; such as words in a sentence &mdash; not every position may contain meaningful information for learning. Loss masking ensures that only the relevant positions are considered during loss computation, while the rest (like padding tokens or ignored tokens) are excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common use of loss masking is to ignore **padding tokens** that are added to make sequences in a batch the same length. Without masking, the model might learn to predict these meaningless tokens, which can degrade performance. Loss masking is also important in tasks like **masked language modeling**, where only specific tokens are meant to be predicted, and the loss is computed solely at those positions. Overall, loss masking helps models focus on meaningful supervision and avoid learning from irrelevant or misleading parts of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the involved computations, loss masking simply means turning off the loss for some positions in the output so that the model ignores them during training. This means that, although very important for a proper model training, loss masking is generally very easy to implement as it does not affect the model itself &mdash; loss masking is model-independent. Let's look at some of the most common reasons to apply loss masking in sequence models."

    "### Padding Masking\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequence models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers &mdash; but also Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) used for sequence data &mdash; require **padding** to handle batches of variable-length sequences efficiently. In natural language processing tasks, input sentences or sequences often vary in length &mdash; see our example batch. However, for parallel processing and efficient use of GPU acceleration, it is essential to organize input data into fixed-size tensors. Padding involves appending special \"padding\" tokens (usually zeros or a designated symbol) to shorter sequences so that all sequences in a batch have the same length. This allows the model to process the batch in a single forward pass without dynamically adjusting for different input lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you try to run the code cell below to convert our example batch into a PyTorch tensor, you would get an error. PyTorch Tensors are required to be \"full\" with respect to all their dimensions. However, our example batch is currently not full with respect to the sequence length dimension since all three sentences have a different length."

    "In principle, RNNs and Transformers can intrinsically handle variable lengths but only if (a) if they process all sequences one by one (i.e., batch size of 1), or (b) if all sequences within at least the same batch have the same length. Training with a batch size of 1 is always possible but typically results in a much lower training speed as the training does not benefit from parallel processing compared to using larger batch sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensuring that a batch contains only sequences of the same length can be a useful alternative from some use cases but it does require additional data preparation steps. It also prohibits that the training data can be randomly shuffled between epochs. Training data are often shuffled between epochs to prevent the model from learning spurious patterns or order-specific dependencies that don't generalize. Shuffling helps ensure that each mini-batch contains a diverse mix of samples, leading to more stable and generalized updates to the model’s parameters. This randomness improves convergence and reduces the risk of overfitting to the order of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, padding is a practical solution that enables efficient training and inference on sequence data with varying lengths. So let's pad our example batch and convert it into a proper PyTorch tensor. First we need to decide on the special word/token and its respective index. While not required, it is very common to set the index of the word representing the padding to $0$ &mdash; and we will see in a bit that this makes handling padding often quite convenient. The word/token can be basically any string, but it should be of course a string that is unique and does not already appear as another word/token in the dataset; here we go with *\"[PAD]\"*:"

The `pad_sequence()` method is a utility function that takes a list of variable-length tensors (typically representing sequences like sentences) and pads them so they all have the same length. It returns a single tensor where shorter sequences are padded with specified value to match the length of the longest sequence. Naturally, we use `PAD_IDX` as the passing value."

The `ignore_index` argument in PyTorch loss functions, such as `nn.CrossEntropyLoss`, allows you to specify a target value that should be excluded from the loss computation. This is particularly useful when dealing with padded sequences in tasks like sequence modeling, where padding tokens are added to ensure uniform sequence length but do not represent meaningful data.

    "\n",
    "Masked Language Modeling (MLM) is a self-supervised learning task used to train language models to understand the structure and meaning of language. In MLM, some tokens in an input sentence are randomly replaced with a special token (e.g., *\"[MASK]\"*), and the model is trained to predict the original tokens based on the surrounding context. This encourages the model to learn deep bidirectional representations, as it must consider both the left and right context to make accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given the sentence *\"the cat [MASK] fish pie\"*, the model learns to predict the missing word *\"ate\"*. This task is most famously used in models like [BERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)), where MLM allows the model to develop a strong understanding of word relationships, syntax, and semantics without needing labeled data. By training on large corpora with this objective, the model can later be fine-tuned for downstream tasks such as question answering, text classification, or named entity recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give an example, let's create another training batch that contains only the longest sentence for our initial example batch &mdash; simply to avoid for padding here &mdash; but replace some of the words with *\"[MASK]\"*. For example, the original BERT model replaced ~15% of all words with *\"[MASK]\"*:\n",

    "### Custom Loss Masking\n",
    "\n",
    "Padding masking and Masked Language Modeling (MLM) are both common and standard reasons for loss masking. Also, both applications apply loss masking to completely ignore certain losses by using binary mask &mdash; that is, the mask contains only $1$s and $0$s. However, the mask may also contain numerical values that can be interpreted as weights to increase or decrease the importance of a certain loss at a certain position. The list below outlines so example for other use cases of loss masking:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Missing data labels:** An annotated dataset might accidentally or purposefully miss individual data items or labels. For example, a dataset for training a Part-of-Speech tagger might not come with tags/labels for numbers or other non-standard words. While we can introduce a default label (e.g., *\"OTHER\"*), we can also mask all the outputs for words or tokens that do not have a label. Sequence data might also miss complete items. Maybe the items where not (properly) recorded (e.g., when Optical Character Recognition (OCR) failed to recognize or word), or items where redacted (e.g., for privacy preservations).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Noisy or uncertain labels:** Annotations may come with additional information how certain or uncertain a label is (e.g., expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100% certainty). For example, our Part-of-Speech dataset might have been labeled by 10 different annotators. Thus, for words where not all 10 annotators agree on the same PoS tag, we can decrease the importance of the losses for those based on the level of agreement: instead of multiplying the initial losses by $0$ we multiply them by values between $0$ and $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Curriculum Learning:** Loss masking for curriculum learning involves selectively including or excluding parts of a sequence from contributing to the loss based on their difficulty or relevance at a given stage of training. Instead of feeding easier examples first (as in traditional curriculum learning), this approach presents full sequences but masks out harder tokens initially, gradually unmasking them as the model improves. This allows the model to focus on learning simpler components first while still seeing the full input context. For example, in a sequence labeling task like Named Entity Recognition (NER), you might initially compute the loss only for easily recognizable entities like *\"John\"* or *\"London\"*, masking out rare or ambiguous tokens like *\"Apple\"* (which could be a company or a fruit)."

While Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) may be trained more efficiently utilizing masking information &mdash; potentially performing less operations for sequences shorter than the longest sequence in a batch &mdash; this is not a required step as it does not affect the underlying training setup and objective.\n",

The main reason for this is that the attention mechanism,  by default, computes the attention weights between all pairs of words in parallel &mdash; in contrast to RNNs that process sequences indeed sequentially. There are various reasons why adding masking to the attention mechanism is required. In the following, we focus on the two most common ones: **padding** (again) and **autoregressive sequence generation** (e.g., text generation in case of words as outputs)."

    "\n",
    "The overall Transformer architecture has to main components: the *encoder* and the *decoder*. The common purpose of the decoder in the Transformer architecture is to generate sequences, typically in a step-by-step, **autoregressive** manner. In the context of text generation, this auto-regressive nature means that each generated token is conditioned on all previously generated tokens, ensuring coherence and grammatical correctness in the output. Essentially, the decoder acts as a powerful conditional language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encoder-Decoder vs Decoder-Only\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformer architectures use both encoder and decoder when the task requires understanding an input sequence and then generating a corresponding output &mdash; a common setup for sequence-to-sequence tasks. For example, in machine translation (e.g., translating English to French), the encoder processes the source sentence to capture its meaning, and the decoder generates the translated output. Architectures like the original Transformer from Vaswani et al. (2017) and T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) use this encoder-decoder structure to handle such tasks effectively by separating input comprehension and output generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, **decoder-only** architectures are used when the model's goal is to generate text based on a prompt or context, without requiring a separate encoded input. These models treat text generation as a language modeling problem, predicting the next word based on previous ones. Basically all popular Large Language Models (LLMs) &mdash; GPT (OpenAI), LLaMA (Meta), Gemini (Google), Claude (Anthropic), Mistral, etc, &mdash; are examples of decoder-only architectures. They are efficient for tasks like story generation, code completion, or question answering, where the context is part of the same sequence being generated rather than a separate input.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "During inferencing, the decoder receives the first $t$ words $w_0, w_1, \\dots, w_t$ as input to predict the next word $w_{t+1}$ at position $t+1$. In other words, the prediction of $w_{t+1}$ only depends on the previous words $w_0, w_1, \\dots, w_t$. In the next step, $w_{t+1}$ is added to the sequence and the new sequence $w_0, w_1, \\dots, w_t, w_{t+1}$ is given to the decoder to predict the next word $w_{t+2}$, and so on &mdash; until the decoder predicts an end-of-sequence token or some other stopping criteria is fulfilled (e.g., maximum sequence length).\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, however, the decoder receives the *complete* sequence. And as for padding, without any considerations, the attention mechanism would compute *all* pairwise attention scores. This means that the output of the decoder at position $t$ would depend on all previous words as well as all subsequent words. In simple terms, during training, the decoder would be able to \"look into the future\". This we have to ensure that each word only attends to previous words but not to subsequent words. We can accomplish this once more through masking, more commonly called **causal masking** because the mask enforces a cause-and-effect relationship in the sequence: each token can only \"see\" (i.e., attend to) previous tokens, not future ones. This preserves the causal structure necessary for autoregressive generation, where each output depends only on what has come before &mdash; not what comes after."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Masking in sequence models refers to techniques used to control which parts of the input or output sequences are considered during training or inference. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that models handle sequences of variable lengths correctly, avoid learning from irrelevant data (like padding), and maintain the correct flow of information (such as preventing a token from attending to future tokens during generation). Masking is essential in both RNN-based and Transformer-based architectures, although the way it is implemented can differ significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first type, **loss masking**, is architecture-independent and is applied after the model’s forward pass. It is commonly used to ignore padding tokens in variable-length sequences during loss computation. For instance, when training on batches with padded sequences, loss masking ensures that the loss function only considers actual tokens (not padding) by applying a binary mask to the loss output. This helps the model focus its learning on meaningful parts of the data and is typically implemented by element-wise multiplying the loss with a mask tensor before computing the final loss value (e.g., via masked_loss = loss * mask).\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, **attention block masking** is architecture-dependent and is particularly relevant in models that use attention mechanisms, like Transformers. This kind of masking modifies how tokens interact during self-attention. One example is causal masking &mdash; used in autoregressive models like GPT, LLaMA, Gemini, Claude, etc. &mdash; where each token is only allowed to attend to previous tokens to preserve the left-to-right nature of generation. Another example is padding masking, where attention scores to padded (irrelevant) tokens are masked out to prevent them from influencing the context representation. These masks are often added before the *softmax* in the attention mechanism to zero out or heavily down-weight unwanted attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, masking in sequence models ensures correct and efficient training by handling variable sequence lengths and enforcing logical constraints on information flow. Loss masking operates independently of the model’s internals and focuses on making the loss computation accurate. Attention masking, however, requires deliberate design changes within the model's architecture and is crucial for guiding how attention is distributed across a sequence. Both are vital tools for building robust and effective sequence models."
