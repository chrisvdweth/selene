    "# Data Batching for Training LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "Training Large Language Models (LLMs) involves processing vast amounts of textual data, often structured as continuous streams of documents. The way this data is segmented and organized into batches directly affects both the model's efficiency and the quality of the representations it learns. In this context, the development of robust and scalable batching strategies is essential &mdash; not only to maximize hardware utilization but also to preserve the linguistic and contextual integrity of the input. Document streams, which provide a sequential flow of text samples (e.g., books, articles, or web pages), pose unique challenges and opportunities for batch construction, particularly when aiming to maintain coherence across sequences while optimizing for parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional batching methods in machine learning often rely on fixed-size token sequences or sentences sampled independently from a large corpus. While effective in smaller settings, these methods can fall short when applied to LLMs trained on document streams, where context continuity and data ordering matter. For example, random sampling might break semantic flow, leading the model to learn representations that ignore broader discourse structure. This motivates the exploration of strategies that more carefully align the structure of batches with the document stream's natural boundaries, such as contiguous chunking, document-aware sampling, or packing strategies that reduce padding and maximize GPU efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "One widely used technique is *token packing*, which combines multiple short sequences into a single input example of fixed length, minimizing padding and improving computational efficiency. This approach is particularly useful when training on datasets with variable-length documents or sentences. Another strategy is *streaming batching*, where documents are consumed in a sequential pipeline, and batches are constructed dynamically to preserve order and reduce fragmentation. More advanced strategies might involve *curriculum learning-inspired batching*, where documents are grouped by difficulty or topic progression to better align with the model's learning phase. Each of these strategies carries trade-offs in terms of complexity, memory usage, and the kind of contextual learning the model can achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the choice of batch generation strategy is tightly coupled with training goals, model architecture, and computational constraints. As LLMs scale to trillions of parameters and datasets grow accordingly, efficient and context-sensitive batching from document streams becomes increasingly critical. It allows models to leverage long-range dependencies in natural language and achieve better generalization, while also ensuring that the infrastructure used for training is not a bottleneck. Research in this area continues to evolve, with hybrid and adaptive batching strategies emerging as promising directions for optimizing both performance and learning quality in large-scale language modeling."

    "When training a Transformer-based large language model using document streams, whether to use overlapping chunks depends on the goals of training and the constraints of computational resources. Generally, overlapping chunks **can be beneficial** because they help preserve continuity in long documents that are broken into fixed-length sequences, a common necessity due to memory limitations. Transformers typically have a maximum context window (e.g., 512, 1024, or 4096 tokens), so long documents must be split into smaller parts. Overlapping chunks ensure that tokens near the boundary of one chunk are not isolated from their neighboring context in the original document, allowing the model to learn smoother and more coherent representations across chunk boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **main advantage** of using overlapping chunks in document streams is that they improve the model's ability to handle long-range dependencies and maintain a consistent narrative flow across chunks. This is particularly useful when training on text types where coherence and sequential understanding are crucial—such as stories, articles, or long-form conversations. With overlap, every token (especially those near the edges of chunks) is given the chance to be seen in a more complete context at least once during training, leading to better language modeling performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **there are trade-offs**. Overlapping increases the amount of data the model sees—but not in a unique way. It introduces redundancy, since the overlapping tokens are processed multiple times, which increases computational cost and training time without adding new information. This can also lead to inefficiencies in memory usage. Therefore, if compute resources are limited or if training speed is a priority, non-overlapping chunks may be preferred. In practice, a hybrid approach is often used—moderate overlap (e.g., 50%) is introduced to balance context preservation with efficiency, especially in early training stages when capturing document-level coherence is important."

    "The splitting of our document stream into chunks that serves as input for our Transformer language model is a core requirement to facilitate the training of models. However, there are also other practical considerations such as the batching of training samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks such as Transformers are typically trained using **batches** &mdash; small subsets of the full training dataset &mdash; rather than the entire dataset (full-batch) or one example at a time (stochastic) because this strikes a balance between computational efficiency** and **learning stability. Processing the full dataset at each training step would be computationally expensive and slow, especially for large datasets, while using just one example per step introduces too much randomness in the learning process. \n",
    "\n",
    "Batching allows the model to see enough examples at once to estimate a reliable gradient for updating weights, but keeps the computations manageable and parallelizable on modern hardware like GPUs. Moreover, training with batches introduces stochasticity** into the learning process, which helps the model escape local minima or saddle points in the loss landscape. This randomness often improves generalization compared to deterministic full-batch training. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the importance and prevalence of batching, most deep learning libraries such as PyTorch offer built-in mechanisms to simplify this process and support more advanced concepts such as parallel processing and training. In the following, we go through some examples of how we can use a text corpus to train a Transformer-based language model in practice."

In other words, the dataset is again a 1-dimensional tensor containing token indices, like the `tokens` variable we have created as our toy document stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "For convenience and later use, we utilize the `Dataset` class in PyTorch, an abstract base class that provides a standard interface for accessing and managing data. To use it, you typically create a custom subclass that overrides two essential methods: `__len__()` to return the size of the dataset, and `__getitem__()` to retrieve a single data sample given an index. This design allows PyTorch to efficiently load and process data on-the-fly, which is particularly useful for large datasets that can't be fully loaded into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "One major benefit of the `Dataset` class is its flexibility. You can use it to wrap any type of data &mdash; images, text, audio, or even data from multiple sources &mdash; and apply custom transformations during retrieval. In our case, we implement our sliding window approach to split the token indices of our document streams into the input and corresponding target chunks with respect to the specified maximum length and stride. Notice how the `__init__()` method implements the same steps we saw in the method `chunk_tokens()`. However, instead of just printing the chunks, we now store all chunks in two lists."

    "Next, the `DataLoader` class in PyTorch is a utility that wraps around a `Dataset` object to efficiently manage the loading of data during training or evaluation. It handles batching of data, optional shuffling, and parallel loading using multiple worker processes. You can specify parameters like `batch_size`, `shuffle`, and `num_workers` to control how data is loaded and fed to your model. This makes it easy to iterate through large datasets in manageable batches, improving memory usage and training speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key benefits of `DataLoader` is its ability to streamline and optimize the data pipeline, especially when working with large datasets or real-time data augmentation. By using multiple workers, it can prefetch and prepare the next batch while the model is training on the current one, effectively overlapping computation and data loading. This leads to more efficient GPU utilization and faster training times. Combined with a custom `Dataset`, the `DataLoader` makes it easy to build flexible, scalable, and high-performance training loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code cell below, we create an instance of the `DataLoader` class with the following arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `token_dataset`: the instance of our `Dataset` subclass containing all the generated input and target chunks forming the individual pairs of training samples\n",
    "\n",
    "* `batch_size=4`: the number of training samples in each batch. In practice the batch size may be much larger, but since our toy document stream is very small, we have to choose a small value to see any effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `shuffle=True`: create new random batches for each iteration over the data loader. Shuffling the dataset into new batches after each training iteration (epoch) is common because it prevents the model from learning the order or patterns in the data sequence, which could lead to overfitting or poor generalization. Without shuffling, the model might repeatedly see the same examples in the same order, which can cause it to memorize specific batch structures or get stuck in suboptimal training dynamics. Shuffling promotes better mixing of examples across batches, leading to more robust and stable gradient estimates, and ultimately helps the model generalize better to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `drop_last=True`: ignores that last batch if it contains an insufficient number of training samples (i.e., less than `batch_size`). The last batch of a training dataset is often ignored if it contains fewer samples than the other batches to maintain consistent batch sizes, which simplifies the training process and avoids potential issues in layers that expect fixed input shapes (like batch normalization). Uneven batch sizes can also affect gradient calculations and performance optimizations, especially when using parallel hardware like GPUs. Ignoring the smaller final batch helps ensure uniformity and stability during training, even if it means slightly fewer training samples are used per epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `num_workers=0`: number of subprocesses used to load data in parallel. Increasing `num_workers` allows data loading (including tasks like reading from disk and applying transformations) to happen concurrently across multiple CPU cores, which can significantly speed up training, especially with large datasets or complex preprocessing. When `num_workers=0`, it means that data loading will happen in the main process, i.e., no parallelism is used. This is simpler and useful for debugging, but it can become a bottleneck in training since the model must wait for data to be loaded and prepared before proceeding to the next batch."

Instead of manually selecting and initializing a specific tokenizer, you can simply use `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"model_name\")`, and it will handle the underlying details based on the model's configuration.

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "When training a Transformer-based language model on continuous document streams, a **sliding window approach** is a common strategy used to generate training batches. This method addresses the fixed-length input constraint of Transformer models, which can’t process arbitrarily long texts at once. Instead of splitting documents randomly or truncating them, the sliding window technique processes long texts in overlapping segments, preserving the contextual flow across input chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sliding window works by taking a fixed-size window (e.g., 512 tokens) and sliding it across the text with a specified stride (e.g., 128 tokens). This generates overlapping sequences where each new window retains some tokens from the previous one. The overlap ensures that the model learns from **context continuity**, capturing dependencies that span across window boundaries—especially important for understanding long-term relationships in language. By adjusting the stride, you can control the trade-off between computational efficiency and contextual coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is particularly useful for streaming or unsegmented documents like books, logs, or transcripts, where there are no natural sentence or paragraph breaks to guide chunking. Unlike sentence-based batching, which might lose context at boundaries, the sliding window maintains a smoother transition between batches. This leads to better language modeling performance, especially for downstream tasks that rely on understanding long-range dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the sliding window method increases data redundancy, since overlapping tokens appear in multiple training samples. While this redundancy can improve learning of certain tokens, it also raises computational costs. To balance performance and efficiency, practitioners often tune the stride size and incorporate masking techniques during training to ensure the model doesn’t \"peek\" at future tokens when predicting. Overall, the sliding window approach is a powerful and practical solution for adapting long-form text to fixed-size Transformer inputs."
