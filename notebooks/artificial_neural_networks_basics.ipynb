    "# Artificial Neural Networks (Basic Architecture)\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a key technology in Artificial Intelligence (AI) inspired by the way the human brain works. Just like the brain uses neurons to process information, ANNs use artificial \"neurons\" to analyze and solve problems. They are a powerful tool for finding patterns in data, making predictions, and learning from experience, much like humans do. ANNs are at the heart of many AI applications we use every day. For example, they power facial recognition systems, language translation tools, voice assistants like Siri or Alexa, and even recommendation systems on platforms like Netflix and Spotify. Their ability to process large amounts of data quickly and identify complex patterns makes them crucial in areas like healthcare, finance, and robotics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning about ANNs is important because they are driving much of the progress in modern AI. Whether you're a student, researcher, or professional, understanding how ANNs work can help you develop innovative solutions to real-world problems. They enable computers to perform tasks that were once thought to require human intelligence, such as recognizing images, predicting outcomes, or even creating original content. ANNs are also a foundation for other advanced AI methods, such as deep learning. By learning how ANNs function, you gain the skills needed to explore these cutting-edge areas. As AI continues to shape industries and improve lives, having knowledge of ANNs gives you the ability to contribute to this exciting field and stay ahead in a rapidly changing world.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, understanding ANNs helps you think critically about their applications and limitations. While they are powerful, ANNs are not perfect and require careful design, training, and evaluation. By learning about them, you can better address challenges like bias in AI systems and make sure the technology is used responsibly and ethically. Overall, Artificial Neural Networks are a cornerstone of AI. Studying them opens the door to new opportunities in technology, research, and innovation. Whether you're curious about AI or looking to build a career in the field, ANNs are a great place to start!"

    "## The Artificial Neuron\n",
    "\n",
    "An artificial neuron is a basic building block of a neural network, designed to mimic the way real neurons in the human brain work. Its primary purpose is to take in information, process it, and decide whether to pass it on to other neurons. In simple terms, it’s like a decision-maker that determines the importance of input data and sends relevant signals forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each artificial neuron takes in inputs, like numbers or features from data, and multiplies them by weights that represent how important each input is. Then, it adds up these weighted inputs and passes the result through an activation function. This function decides whether the neuron \"fires\" or stays inactive, shaping the output in a way that helps the network learn patterns in data. By adjusting the weights during training, the neuron learns to focus on what matters most in solving a problem, like recognizing an image or predicting an outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "When many neurons are connected together in layers, they form a neural network capable of learning complex patterns and relationships. The artificial neuron's ability to filter and transform information is what makes these networks powerful tools for solving a wide range of problems, from language translation to medical diagnosis."

    "The main components of a biological neuron are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dendrite:** A dendrite is a part of a neuron that looks like a branching tree. Its main job is to receive signals from other neurons and send them to the cell body of the neuron. These signals help the neuron decide whether to send its own message to other neurons. Dendrites have many branches, allowing them to connect with thousands of other neurons. They process the signals they receive, which can either excite or calm the neuron. This process is essential for how the brain and nervous system communicate and process information.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cell body:** The cell body, or *soma*, of a neuron is the central part of the cell that contains the nucleus. Its main purpose is to support the neuron's overall function by maintaining cell health and processing incoming signals. The cell body produces energy, proteins, and other materials needed for the neuron's activity. It also integrates the electrical signals received from the dendrites. If these signals reach a certain threshold, the cell body generates an action potential, which is then sent down the axon to communicate with other neurons or tissues.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Nucleus:** The nucleus of a biological neuron is the control center of the cell, located within the cell body. Its main purpose is to regulate the neuron's activities, such as growth, repair, and the production of proteins necessary for communication and function. The nucleus contains the neuron's DNA, which holds the instructions for making proteins and other molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Axon:** The axon is a long, slender part of a neuron that transmits electrical signals, called action potentials, away from the cell body to other neurons, muscles, or glands. Its main purpose is to carry messages over long distances within the nervous system.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Axon terminal:** The axon terminal, also called the synaptic terminal, is the endpoint of a neuron's axon. Its main purpose is to transmit signals to other neurons, muscles, or glands. It does this by releasing chemical messengers called neurotransmitters into the synapse, the small gap between neurons or other target cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Myelin sheath, Schwann cells, and nodes of Ranvier:** The myelin sheath, Schwann cells, and nodes of Ranvier work together to ensure fast and efficient signal transmission along a neuron's axon. The myelin sheath is a fatty, insulating layer that surrounds the axon and speeds up electrical signal transmission by preventing signal loss and allowing it to travel more efficiently. Schwann cells produce and maintain the myelin sheath and assist in repairing damaged axons by promoting regrowth and regeneration after injury. Nodes of Ranvier are small gaps between segments of the myelin sheath along the axon. They play a key role in a process called saltatory conduction, where the electrical signal jumps from one node to the next. This dramatically increases the speed of signal transmission compared to an unmyelinated axon."

    "### Biological Neuron vs. Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In a very simplified manner, we can describe the inner workings of a biological neuron as follows:\n",
    "* *A biological neuron receives input signals from other neurons through its dendrites. These inputs are combined in the cell body, where the neuron decides whether to \"fire\" or send an output signal. This process depends on the total input and a threshold. If the input exceeds the threshold, the neuron sends an output through its axon to the next neuron.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's consider equally simplified description of a Logistic Regression model:\n",
    "* *A Logistic Regression takes multiple input features, combines them using weights (similar to synaptic strengths in a neuron), and applies a mathematical transformation to decide the output. The combined inputs are passed through a sigmoid function, which produces a probability between 0 and 1. If the probability crosses a certain threshold, the output is classified into one category; otherwise, it falls into another.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, Logistic Regression can be considered a mathematical model of a biological neuron with several key parallels:\n",
    "* Input Signals: In a biological neuron, these are electrical signals; in logistic regression, they are numerical feature values.\n",
    "* Weights: Biological neurons use synaptic strengths, while logistic regression uses weights for input features.\n",
    "* Combination of Inputs: Both systems sum their inputs before processing them further.\n",
    "* Activation Function: Biological neurons use a thresholding mechanism; logistic regression uses the sigmoid function for probabilistic output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these similarities, an **artificial neuron** is in essence nothing else than a Logistic Regression model; although, in the content of ANNs, the Logistic Regression model is often slightly modified, e.g., by using other activation functions beyond the Sigmoid function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, a biological neuron is much more complex than an artificial neuron because of its detailed structure and dynamic abilities. A biological neuron has parts like dendrites, the cell body, and axon, each with specific roles in receiving and sending signals. It also uses chemical signals (neurotransmitters) to communicate with other neurons. Biological neurons can adapt over time, change the strength of their connections, and learn from experience, making them highly flexible. On the other hand, artificial neurons are simpler mathematical models used in AI. They take inputs, process them, and produce an output based on a set of weights and an activation function. While artificial neurons can \"learn\" through training, their learning process is much more rigid and not as flexible as biological neurons. Biological neurons can also communicate in more complex ways and use less energy, making them far more efficient and robust compared to artificial neurons.\n"

As we will see later, the output of an artificial neuron that returns the final output of a neural network is generally not required to be interpreted as a probability. This allows for the application for a wide range of activation functions. Therefore, the more general graphical representation of an artificial neuron is shown below."

    "A single artificial neuron can be considered the smallest possible neural network. However, unsurprisingly, a single neuron &mdash; being essentially a Logistic Regression model &mdash; is a rather simple model. Logistic Regression, and hence a single neuron, is a binary classifier. This means that the decision boundary of a neuron that separates the classes is a straight line (in 2D), a plane (in 3D), or a hyperplane (in higher dimensions). However, for many real-world datasets, such simple decision boundaries are not suitable. To give an example consider the following figure. It shows the data distribution of a binary classification dataset (Class $Red$ and Class $Blue$), as well as the decision boundary a Logistic Regression model would learn."

GPUs were originally built for rendering graphics in video games, but their ability to perform lots of calculations in parallel makes them great for training neural networks. TPUs are even more specialized. They are designed specifically for machine learning tasks, especially for training and running deep neural networks. Unlike GPUs, which are general-purpose, TPUs are built to process the kinds of math (like matrix multiplications) that neural networks rely on. This makes TPUs faster and more efficient than GPUs for many machine learning tasks, especially at a large scale."

To keep it simple &mdash; but also align it with a later discussion &mdash; we consider a very small network with only a single hidden layer of three neurons. An input $\\mathbf{x}$ has only two features: $x_1$ and $x_2$. The output layer has only a single neuron. We consider a binary classification just like basic Linear Regression. Thus, the activation function of the output neuron is the Sigmoid function. Although not mandatory, we also assume the activation function of the hidden layer to be the Sigmoid function. In short, each neuron in the network indeed mimics a Logistic Regression model. The figure below visualizes our small ANN."

    "In very simple terms, we can see how each neuron in the hidden layer can model a different decision boundary, and the output neuron then combines them to the final decision boundary shown in the scatter plots above. More generally, the organization of neurons into layers and the combination of their outputs by subsequent layers allows the network to model nonlinear functions mapping the input to some output, which a Logistic Regression model is not capable of.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just by looking at the examples, you might wonder if by simple adding more and more neurons to the hidden layer a network could model *any* non-linear functions. And this is indeed correct! The [**Universal Approximation Theorem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem) states that a feedforward neural network with a single hidden layer containing a sufficient number of neurons can approximate any continuous function on a compact domain, provided it uses a non-linear activation function. This highlights the theoretical power of neural networks to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs. It provides the foundation for understanding why neural networks can be effective in tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and other areas of machine learning. However, while the theorem demonstrates that a single hidden layer is sufficient in theory, there are practical reasons why neural networks often utilize multiple hidden layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Efficiency and Scalability:** A single hidden layer network may require an impractically large number of neurons to approximate complex functions, leading to increased computational costs and difficulty in training. Deep networks, with multiple hidden layers, can represent complex functions more compactly by learning hierarchical features. Each layer captures increasingly abstract features (e.g., edges in the first layer, textures in the second, and objects in higher layers in image processing tasks), making the model both more efficient and interpretable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Training and Generalization:** Deep networks often generalize better to unseen data than wide, shallow networks. Multiple layers allow the network to decompose a task into simpler subtasks, with each layer specializing in different aspects of the data. This hierarchical learning reduces the risk of overfitting, especially when combined with regularization techniques like dropout or weight decay.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Optimization Challenges:** While the theorem guarantees the existence of a solution for a single-layer network, it doesn’t address the difficulty of finding that solution through training. In practice, deep networks are often easier to train with modern optimization techniques like backpropagation and gradient descent, especially when paired with activation functions that mitigate issues like vanishing gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while the Universal Approximation Theorem demonstrates the theoretical capability of single-layer networks, the practical advantages of efficiency, generalization, and trainability make multiple hidden layers the preferred choice in modern deep learning architectures."

    "## Summary & What's Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we covered the basic architecture of Artificial Neural Network, how it can be seen as an \"evolution\" of Logistic Regression. The architecture consists of layers of interconnected neurons, on a high level mimicking the way biological neurons process information. An ANN typically has three types of layers: the *input layer*, which receives data; one or more *hidden layers*, where computations and transformations occur; and the output layer, which provides the final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression can be seen as a simple neural network with no hidden layers, where a single output neuron uses the Sigmoid activation function to predict probabilities for binary classification. In this sense, logistic regression serves as the foundation for ANNs, and extending it with additional layers and neurons allows ANNs to handle more complex, non-linear relationships in data. Thus, ANNs generalize the principles of Logistic Regression, making them highly versatile for various machine learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we have seen how the output of an ANN is generated through layer-wise calculations using matrix and vector operations, we so far skipped the actual training of a network; which will walk about in a separate notebook. However, assuming you are familiar with training or fitting a Logistic Regression model, training an ANN involves the exact same principle steps. Appreciate that whether having a single neuron (i.e., Logistic Regression) or many neurons organized in many stacked layers, a neural network can always bees as as some function, commonly denoted as $\\mathbf{y} = h_{\\mathbf{w}}(\\mathbf{x})$ that maps some input $\\mathbf{x}$ to some output $\\mathbf{x}$ based in some internal parameters or weights $\\mathbf{w}$. As such, the training of an ANN comes down to the same two steps as for Logistic Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Definition of a suitable loss function $L(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}, \\mathbf{y})$ to quantify the difference between the predicted and the true class labels with respect to a current set of weights $\\mathbf{w}$ to assess how well a network performs on a classification or predictions task.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Application of a suitable training strategy to *systematically* the best (or close to best) weight parameters $\\mathbf{w}$ that minimize the loss function $L$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of Logistic Regression, the loss function of choice was the Cross-Entropy Loss, and we could use Gradient Descent to minimize that loss function. And in fact, for basic classification tasks, ANNs also rely on the Cross-Entropy Loss and Gradient Descent for their training. That being said, the function $h_{\\mathbf{w}}(\\mathbf{x})$ described by an ANN with many layers and neurons per layer is much more complex compared to $h_{\\mathbf{w}}(\\mathbf{x})$ for Logistic Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "* With $y = h_{\\mathbf{w}}(\\mathbf{x})$ being more complex, the loss function $L(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}, \\mathbf{y})$ will naturally also be more complex. This makes the calculation of the gradient to train the network by iteratively updating the weights $\\mathbf{w}$ much more challenging. Similar to the layer-wise calculation of the output of an ANN (see above), the calculation of the gradients is also done layer by layer via the process of [**backpropagation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation) which starts at the output layer and calculates the gradient by going back through the network until the input layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The complexity of $L(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}, \\mathbf{y})$ also causes the loss function to be no longer convex like the Cross-Entropy Loss for Logistic Regression. This means that $L$ no longer has a single minimum, but can have many local minima and saddle points. This makes efficiently training large ANN much more challenging compared to much simpler models such as Logistic Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Large ANNs may have a huge amount of trainable weights $\\mathbf{w}$. This gives ANNs the capacity to learn very complex nonlinear functions. On the flips side, this increased model capacity also increases the risk of [**overfitting**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting), i.e., the risk of the model learning the noise in the training data and therefore performing poorly on new unseen data. Training large ANNs therefore requires effective [**regularization**]() techniques.\n",
