    "# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Handwritten digit recognition** is a classic task in machine learning where the goal is to develop algorithms that can accurately interpret and classify images of handwritten digits (typically 0 through 9). A well-known benchmark dataset for this task is the MNIST dataset, which contains thousands of labeled examples of handwritten digits written by different people. The challenge lies in enabling computers to recognize the variability in individual handwriting styles, sizes, and shapes, despite distortions, noise, or inconsistencies in the input images. This task typically involves techniques such as image preprocessing, feature extraction, and the application of machine learning models like neural networks, support vector machines, or more recently, deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Handwritten digit recognition is important because it serves as a foundational problem in the broader field of pattern recognition and computer vision. Solving this problem effectively demonstrates the potential of machines to interpret and process human-generated data, paving the way for more complex tasks like automatic document processing, check verification in banks, and digitizing handwritten forms. Beyond its practical applications, it is also a widely used educational tool and benchmark to evaluate and compare machine learning algorithms, helping researchers refine techniques that are later adapted for more advanced problems in image classification, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **MNIST dataset** (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset) is a large collection of handwritten digits that is widely used as a benchmark for evaluating machine learning models, especially in the field of image classification. It consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits &mdash; 60,000 images in the training set and 10,000 in the test set &mdash; with each image being a 28$\\times$28 pixel square. Each image is labeled with the correct digit it represents (0 through 9), making it a supervised learning dataset. The dataset was created by modifying and combining samples from the original NIST datasets, which contained handwriting from American Census Bureau employees and high school students, to create a more standardized and accessible resource for machine learning research.\n",
    "\n",
    "MNIST gained popularity because it is relatively small and simple, making it an ideal starting point for testing and validating new image recognition algorithms. Despite its simplicity, it captures enough variability in handwriting to present a meaningful challenge, allowing researchers and practitioners to experiment with preprocessing methods, feature extraction, and different classification algorithms. Over time, MNIST has become a standard benchmark for assessing the performance of models like logistic regression, support vector machines, and convolutional neural networks, and it has played a significant role in advancing developments in computer vision and deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we address the task of handwritten digit recognition using basic Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). We will see that even a small ANN will yield good results, and we will discuss at the end why this task does not necessarily require more sophisticated neural network architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)."

If data is always fed to the model in the same sequence, the model might overfit to that specific order, which can reduce its ability to generalize to unseen data.

By shuffling, each mini-batch becomes a more representative mix of the overall dataset, leading to more stable and effective gradient estimates, which often results in faster convergence and better generalization.\n",

    "Even when starting from an untrained model, you should see that the model already achieves an F1 score of about $0.9$ after the first epoch, and then only improves slightly more over time. This is because the task is a relatively easy one even for a simple ANN, as we will discuss more at the end. Since we keep track of the loss as well as the F1 scores regarding the training and the test data, we can also plot the results use the auxiliary method `plot_training_results()` we provide."

    "\n",
    "Although our model seems to work reasonably well, it is of course not perfect as it misclassified some images from the test dataset. Let's therefore have a closer look at what images of handwritten digits our model recognized incorrectly. **Error analysis** in machine learning is the process of carefully studying the mistakes a model makes &mdash; looking at the cases where it gets predictions wrong &mdash; to understand why those errors happen. By examining these incorrect predictions, you can find patterns, such as certain types of inputs the model struggles with or parts of the data that are confusing or mislabeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of error analysis is to get insights that help improve the model, whether by fixing data problems, adjusting the model, or changing how you train it. It's a way to make smarter decisions about what to fix next, instead of just blindly trying random improvements. While further improvements are beyond the scope of this notebook, we can still look at some mistakes of our model to get some ideas of its weaknesses. For this, we simply iterate again through all the samples in our test dataset and keep track of the true and predicted class labels for each image."

    "Using the code below, we can not find all misclassifications by finding the indices in the arrays `y_true` and `y_pred` where the values in both arrays differ. The `equal()` method in Numpy compares two arrays element by element and returns a new array of `True` or `False` values, showing where the elements are exactly the same. Since we are interested in the values that are not the same, we can flip the Boolean values in the array using `~`. We then also cast the Boolean area into an integer array where all `False` values become $0$ and all `True` values become $1$. Lastly, `flatnonzero()` method returns the indices of all the non-zero elements in an array. After all, we do not care about the predictions our model got right."

    "When looking at the examples above, you are likely to see cases where it is rather easy why the model has made a wrong prediction. For example, a \"sloppy\" $2$ (with only a small bottom part) can be mistaken for a $7$. On the other hand, you are also likely to see some cases where the digit is generally properly written but the model still recognizes it as a different digit. These cases highlight why understanding how a trained model works is both important and challenging. For example, if two very similar-looking images return different predictions, it may mean that the model is rather \"brittle\" &mdash; just small changes to the input can quickly alter the predicted output. But again, a deeper discussion is beyond the scope of this notebook."

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we addressed the task of handwritten digit recognition using a simple artificial neural network (ANN), and saw that the model performed arguably quite well. One might therefore wonder why ANNs are generally not used for similar image classification tasks. The answer to this question lies in the simple nature of the dataset in terms of the variety of the training samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that MNIST images are size-normalized and centered when using simple neural networks (fully connected networks, i.e., ANNs) because these networks do not naturally understand the spatial structure of images. A fully connected neural network treats the image as just a long list of numbers (e.g., 784 pixel values), without knowing which pixels are near each other or where features like edges and curves are located. If the digit is off-center or varies too much in size, the same number might produce very different patterns of pixel values, making it harder for the network to learn consistent patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Size-normalizing** the digits makes sure that all the handwritten numbers are roughly the same scale. This means, for example, that a small \"5\" does not get confused with noise or looks completely different from a large \"5\". When the size is consistent, the neural network sees more similar pixel patterns for the same digit across many examples, which helps it learn more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Centering** the digits means aligning them so they sit roughly in the middle of the image, which reduces variation in where the important features (like loops or lines) appear within the pixel grid. If the same digit appears in different corners of the image, a simple neural network (which has no idea about \"position\") will struggle to recognize them as the same digit. Centering helps ensure that, no matter who wrote the digit, it shows up in the same general spot, again making it easier for the model to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** are much better at handling shifts, scale changes, and spatial patterns because they process images in small patches and can recognize patterns no matter where they appear. But in simple ANNs, we need to help the model by making the images as uniform as possible &mdash; hence the importance of size-normalization and centering."

    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Recognizing handwritten digits is a classic task in machine learning where the goal is to build a model that can correctly identify the number (0 to 9) written in an image. A popular dataset for this task is MNIST, which contains thousands of grayscale images of handwritten digits, each 28$\\times$28 pixels in size. The job of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is to take these images as input and predict the correct digit label for each one. A basic artificial neural network for this task typically has an input layer with 784 neurons (since 28$\\times$28 = 784 pixels), one or more hidden layers where the model learns patterns in the data, and an output layer with 10 neurons &mdash; one for each possible digit. \n",
    "\n",
    "The network learns by adjusting the weights in these layers to reduce the difference between its predicted digit and the actual digit, using a process called backpropagation and an optimizer like Adam or Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). During training, the model is shown many examples of images and their correct labels so it can gradually improve its ability to recognize patterns like loops, edges, and shapes that make up different digits. Once trained, the model can be tested on new, unseen images to see how well it generalizes to new handwriting styles. This task is a great introduction to neural networks because it's simple yet powerful enough to show how models can learn to make accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, even basic neural networks can achieve surprisingly good accuracy on handwritten digit recognition, but more advanced models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) often do even better because they’re specially designed to work with image data. Still, using a basic ANN for this task is a great way to understand how neural networks work and how they can be applied to solve real-world problems."
