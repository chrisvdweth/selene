    "# Implementing an ANN from Scratch (NumPy only)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through the implementation of a simple artificial neural network (ANN) for handwritten digit classification on the MNIST dataset, built **entirely from scratch using only NumPy**. The goal is deliberately *not* to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy or training efficiency. Instead, the focus is on exposing the core mechanics of neural networks by explicitly implementing every component that modern deep-learning frameworks usually abstract away.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model architecture is intentionally minimal and consists of a sequence of **linear (fully connected) layers**, **ReLU activation functions**, and a **combined softmax + cross-entropy loss layer**. Each layer is implemented as an individual class with a clearly defined **forward pass** and **backward pass**, making the flow of data and gradients through the network explicit. By working directly with matrix operations and derivatives, this notebook highlights how backpropagation is realized in practice without relying on automatic differentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A central theme of the notebook is understanding how gradients are computed and propagated efficiently. Rather than forming large Jacobian matrices, the backward passes are derived and implemented in a way that mirrors how real frameworks compute gradients under the hood. The combined softmax and cross-entropy layer, in particular, demonstrates how careful mathematical simplifications lead to both numerical stability and simpler gradient expressions—an approach used by libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the notebook, you should have a clear mental model of what happens during training: how inputs are transformed layer by layer, how the loss quantifies prediction errors, how gradients flow backward through the network, and how parameters are updated via gradient descent. While real-world frameworks offer powerful features such as automatic differentiation, GPU acceleration, and highly optimized kernels, implementing an ANN in pure NumPy provides valuable insight into *why* these tools are designed the way they are, and just how much complexity they manage on your behalf."

    "A very important observation is that the MNIST dataset (and similar datasets containing hand-written digits) contains **size-normalized** and **centered** digits in **fixed-size images** &mdash; more specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Size-normalized:** Each handwritten digit has been scaled so that its shape roughly fits within a standard size, regardless of how large or small the original handwritten digit was. This means tall, narrow, short, or wide digits are all resized to be comparable in scale, which reduces variability caused by different handwriting styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Centered in fixed-size images:** Every digit is placed in the middle of a 28$\\times$28 pixel image. The image size is fixed &mdash; that is, all images have exactly the same dimensions. The digit itself is centered within the image so that it does not touch the edges and is consistently located, making it easier for machine learning models to learn relevant patterns without worrying about positional shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This preprocessing step helps ensure that the variation in the dataset comes mainly from handwriting style rather than inconsistencies in size or position, which simplifies the task for machine learning models and is eventually the reason why more sophisticated neural network architectures such as CNNs are not required to address this task of handwritten digit recognition.\n",

    "Before we can use the dataset for training our model, we have one last step to do. Our model uses a basic implementation of the corss-entropy loss which expects, apart from the softmax probabilities, the ground truth as a one-hot vector for each training sample. However, right now, each label of a training sample is represented by an integer value reflecting the true class of that sample. This mean we need to convert the labels for the training data into one-hot vectors, e.g.:"

We do this using built-in methods from the scikit-learn library, and these methods work directly with the class labels instead of one-hot vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Side note:** In practice, virtually all major deep-learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow compute the cross-entropy loss directly from integer class labels rather than one-hot vectors, because this is both more **efficient and numerically stable**. Internally, these libraries fuse the softmax and cross-entropy operations into a single optimized kernel that only needs the index of the correct class, avoiding the explicit construction of large, mostly zero one-hot tensors and unnecessary multiplications. This reduces memory usage, improves performance, and allows the loss to be computed via simple indexed log-probabilities, while still yielding the same gradients as the one-hot formulation.

In practice, when implementing backpropagation, this point is handled by convention: most frameworks simply set the gradient to $0$ (sometimes $1$), but since the probability of a neuron being *exactly* at zero is negligible, this choice has no practical impact on training. Intuitively, this means gradients flow unchanged through ReLU for positive activations, while neurons with negative pre-activations block the gradient entirely.\n",

    "These simple operations make the ReLU activation also very easy to implement; see the `ReLU` class in the code cell below. The expression `(self.X > 0)` in the `backward()` method creates a boolean mask that is `True` where the input was positive and `False` where it was non-positive. In NumPy, this mask is implicitly converted to `1` (for `True`) and `0` (for `False`) during multiplication. As a result, the gradient is passed through unchanged for elements where `X > 0` and zeroed out everywhere else. This is exactly how the piecewise gradient of ReLU is applied efficiently without explicitly writing conditional statements."

By shifting the logits so that the largest value becomes $0$, all exponentials are guaranteed to be at most $1$, keeping the computation in a safe numerical range. This works because softmax is invariant to adding or subtracting the same constant from all inputs, making the trick a simple yet essential step for reliable and stable training.\n",

When the loss is defined as the *mean* over the batch rather than the sum, each sample contributes equally regardless of batch size, and the magnitude of the gradients remains stable as the batch size changes. This helps keep learning rates meaningful and comparable: doubling the batch size does not automatically double the gradient magnitudes or require returning the optimizer. In practice, averaging over the batch leads to more predictable optimization dynamics and simplifies both theoretical reasoning and practical implementation of gradient-based learning."

    "Despite having $60k$ images in the training data, we could use the full dataset as a single batch for each training epoch. However, just to show a basic example how it can be done &mdash; although not in a very optimized way &mdash; we actually split the training data into multiple batches using the method `create_batches` below. If specified by the `shuffle` argument, the method first shuffles the data before creating the batches. Training data is often shuffled after each epoch to prevent the model from learning spurious patterns caused by the order of the data, such as correlations between consecutive samples. Shuffling ensures that each mini-batch is a different mix of examples across epochs, which leads to more representative gradient estimates, reduces bias during optimization, and generally improves convergence and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "For improved efficiency, instead of return a list of all batches at once, we the `yield` keyword to turn the methods into a **generator function**. Instead of returning a value once and terminating (as `return` does), `yield` produces a value and temporarily pauses the function's execution, saving its internal state. When the generator is iterated again, execution resumes exactly where it left off. This allows values to be generated **lazily**, one at a time, rather than all at once. This will later allow us to iterate through the batches one by one (see the `train_epoch()` method next)."

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing a neural network from scratch using only NumPy without any deep-learning framework or library is very educational in terms of understanding core concepts such as backpropagation and, in general, how deep-learning frameworks work. Of course, in practice, particularly when it comes to more complex models and much larger datasets, you want to use established frameworks such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, or others. Their implementations of all components (e.g., layers, activation functions, loss functions) are highly optimized and unlikely to contain any bugs. This means that you have much less code to write which also reduces the risk of errors. However, apart from more leaner code, deep-learning frameworks also provide other extremely practical benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **GPU support:** Modern deep-learning frameworks allow models to be trained and executed on CPUs and GPUs in a largely transparent manner: the same high-level model definition and training code can be reused, with only minimal changes (often just moving tensors to a device) to switch between hardware backends. Training on a GPU offers significant benefits because GPUs are optimized for massively parallel numerical computations, making them especially efficient for matrix multiplications and tensor operations that dominate deep learning workloads. NumPy only runs on the CPU; however, [CuPy](https://cupy.dev/) is considered a drop-in replacement for NumPy that runs on GPUs (but or requires CUDA to be installed).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Parallel training & inference:** Apart from GPU support, most frameworks are designed from the ground up to support parallel training of large models, which is essential as model sizes and datasets continue to grow. They provide built-in abstractions for data parallelism, model parallelism, and distributed training across multiple GPUs or even multiple machines, while automatically handling synchronization, gradient aggregation, and communication. This allows you to scale training efficiently without rewriting core model logic. Parallel training not only reduces wall-clock training time but also makes it feasible to train models that would otherwise exceed the memory or compute limits of a single device, enabling faster experimentation and the development of increasingly powerful models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Extended functionalities:** Beyond core model definition and training, deep-learning frameworks provide a rich ecosystem of supporting functionality that greatly simplifies real-world workflows. They offer efficient and flexible data-loading pipelines with batching, shuffling, and parallel preprocessing, which are critical for keeping accelerators fully utilized. Frameworks also include tools for debugging and inspection, such as gradient checking, tensor shape validation, and visualization utilities, making it easier to diagnose and fix issues during development. In addition, they support exporting trained models to standardized formats for deployment, allowing the same model to run efficiently on different devices such as servers, mobile phones, or embedded systems, thereby bridging the gap between research and production.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, for any practical implementations, you want to utilize existing and mature deep-learning frameworks for training and inference."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated how to build and train a simple artificial neural network (ANN) for handwritten digit classification on the MNIST dataset using **only NumPy**, without relying on high-level deep learning frameworks. The implementation covered the full training pipeline—from forward propagation through linear layers and nonlinear activations to loss computation and parameter updates—making every step of the learning process explicit and transparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal was not to achieve state-of-the-art performance, but to **develop an intuitive and practical understanding of how modern deep learning frameworks operate under the hood**. By manually implementing components such as linear layers, ReLU activations, and softmax with cross-entropy loss, the notebook exposed the mechanics that libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow abstract away. This helps demystify training dynamics, gradient flow, and numerical considerations that are often hidden behind concise APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this notebook focused on the end-to-end implementation of the network, the mathematical derivations of the backward pass for the individual layers are covered in separate, dedicated notebooks. Those notebooks dive deeply into the required calculus and matrix operations, allowing this notebook to emphasize how those gradients are assembled and used during training in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these fundamentals is crucial for anyone aiming to work seriously with deep learning. A solid grasp of forward and backward passes, gradient computation, and parameter updates enables better debugging, more informed architectural choices, and a deeper appreciation of why certain design patterns dominate modern neural network frameworks."
