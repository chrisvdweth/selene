    "# Multinomial Naive Bayes (Basics)\n",
    "\n",
    "Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) is a specialized variant of the Naive Bayes algorithm, primarily designed for classification tasks involving discrete data, such as text and document classification. It operates on the assumption that the features (e.g., words in a document) follow a multinomial distribution, making it particularly effective in contexts where data is represented as counts or frequencies. MNB calculates the probability of a given class based on the product of the conditional probabilities of its features, weighted by their frequencies in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Difference from General Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "The general Naive Bayes algorithm includes a family of classifiers that assume independence among features but differ in the probability distributions they use. For example, Gaussian Naive Bayes assumes features follow a normal distribution, making it suitable for continuous data. In contrast, Multinomial Naive Bayes assumes a multinomial distribution, explicitly designed for discrete data, such as word occurrences or categorical variables. This makes MNB particularly adept at tasks like spam detection, sentiment analysis, or topic classification, where data is often in the form of word counts or term frequencies. A critical distinction lies in how these algorithms handle data representation. While Gaussian Naive Bayes can handle continuous variables, MNB is optimized for integer or non-negative data, such as word counts. This optimization allows MNB to outperform other Naive Bayes variants in tasks where text data or categorical features are involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importance of Learning Multinomial Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding Multinomial Naive Bayes is crucial for anyone working in natural language processing (NLP) or text mining. It is a cornerstone algorithm for text classification problems, offering simplicity, efficiency, and effectiveness. For example, when dealing with large-scale datasets like emails, news articles, or customer reviews, MNB provides a computationally efficient method to build reliable models without extensive preprocessing or computational overhead. Moreover, learning MNB provides insights into probabilistic reasoning, feature independence assumptions, and how distributions can be tailored to specific data types. It often serves as a benchmark for evaluating more complex machine learning algorithms, helping practitioners assess the trade-offs between simplicity and performance. Understanding MNB also aids in comprehending fundamental NLP techniques like the bag-of-words and TF-IDF representations. By mastering MNB, learners gain a practical and theoretical foundation for tackling real-world problems in text analytics, paving the way for advanced exploration of machine learning models. Its simplicity, combined with its practical relevance, makes it a vital tool in the machine learning toolkit."

    "## Motivating Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume you want to build a classifier that automatically assigns a news article to a set of predefined categories (e.g., politics, sports, business, entertainment, lifestyle, etc.). This is a very common example for a text or document classification task. To keep it simple and allow for a better explanation of MNB classifier, we consider only single sentences as our input documents and only two class labels (*politics* and *sports*). Lastly, let's assume we only have sentences in our whole training dataset, four of class *politics* and three of class *sports*. In more detail, our example dataset we will be using throughout the notebook looks as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Sentence                                            \t| Class   \t|\n",
    "|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n",
    "| *The mayor was elected for this term and next term.*\t| *politics*  |\n",
    "| *A mayor's goal for the next term is to win.*       \t| *politics*  |\n",
    "| *The goal for this term was to win the vote.*       \t| *politics*  |\n",
    "| *This term's goals are next term's goals.*          \t| *politics*  |\n",
    "| *The goal of any team player is the win.*           \t| *sports*\t|\n",
    "| *A win for the team is a win for each player.*      \t| *sports*\t|\n",
    "| *Players vote other players for another term.*      \t| *sports*\t|\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we delve deeper into the inner workings of the MNB algorithm for classification, let's first try to get the basic underlying intuition the algorithm is based on. To do this, have another look at the example dataset above, but only consider the sentences and ignore the class labels. In other words, the class labels are not given, and assume that your task is now to decide whether a sentence came from a news article about politics or sports. Even without the class labels, most would probably say that the first four sentences are from political articles, while the last three sentences are from sports articles. But think about how you would explain your decisions. A simple and handwavy answer would be to say that the first four sentences just \"talk about politics\". But how can we make this statement more precise?\n",
    "\n",
    "The core argument &mdash; and the core idea behind MNB &mdash; is that a sentence that \"talks about politics\" contains words that are more likely to be associated with political topics. For example, the word *\"mayor\"* is much more likely to appear in a political article compared to one about sports. Similarly, the word *\"player\"* is arguably more likely associated with topics about sports. However, this does *not* mean that words such as  *\"mayor\"* may never appear in a sports article &mdash; for example, consider the sentence: *\"The team won the match and the mayor congratulated\"*. In other words, we cannot apply hard rules that merely check for the presence or absence of words. Instead we need soft rules to help us quantify the strength of the associations of words to topics. We can then use these learned associations to predict the class (e.g., the topic) of an article based on the words it contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the MNB classification algorithm, we express the associations between words and classes in terms of probabilities. In a nutshell, the MNB algorithm learns the probabilities of seeing a word in a document of a given class (for all different classes). Based on those probabilities, the algorithm can then predict the probability of a document belonging to a class based on the words within the document. The class with the highest probability for a document is the one that will be the final prediction for that document."

Calculating joint probabilities by calculating all conditional probabilities for all documents and class quickly becomes computationally very expensive. This is particularly true if the number of features &mdash; the number of unique words/tokens (i.e., the vocabulary) in the context of document classification &mdash; increases. The second problem is **data sparsity**. In many real-word corpora, certain combinations of features (i.e., words/tokens) occur rarely or may not appear in the training data at all. This is particularly true for natural language text which is highly variable and with a large vocabulary size resulting in many possible word combinations. Also, the sequence $w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_n, y_i$ can be of arbitrary length, making the space of possible word sequences extremely large. This results in a high-dimensional problem where modeling the joint probability distribution is complex. During training, this means that many conditional probabilities will be very small. Since the likelihood requires the multiplication of $n$ conditional probabilities &mdash; with potentially very small values &mdash; this can cause problems with computational stability due to a limited precision of machines and algorithms.\n",

    "The MNB classification algorithm therefore makes the \"naive\" assumption that all features are independent. Of course, this assumption does strictly not hold in practice when we are assuming the features are words in a document. For example, when we are seeing the word *\"York\"* in a sentence, it's also very likely to also see the word *\"New\"* in the same sentence. However, for document classification tasks, it turns out that assuming independence between words works well in practice, and the NMB algorithm often performs surprisingly well. For one, it still captures enough useful patterns in the data &mdash; that is, that individual words are often more associated with one class than others.

    "While Smoothing ensures that none of the conditional probabilities $P(w_i|y_i)$ are $0$, those probabilities are typically still very small for real-world datasets. Particularly in the case of long documents, we need to multiply many very small probability values. On normal computers with a naturally limited precision , this can lead to arithmetic underflow, negatively affecting the numerical stability of the calculations. It is therefore common to calculate the log probabilities instead of the raw probabilities. Since the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function, it does not affect the order of the final posterior probabilities. As such, we can write:\n",

    "\n",
    "The MNB classification algorithm only considers the presence or absence of words in a document and therefore only considers the Bag-of-Word (BoW) representation of documents. With the focus on the presence and absence of words, we often want to ignore the variation of words, including (a) whether verbs are in the present, past, or progressing form, (b) whether nouns are in singular or plural form, (c) whether adjectives are in their base, comparative, or superlative form, or (d) whether words are capitalized or not. Thus, it is very common to perform case-folding, and stemming or lemmatization as preprocessing steps for training a MNB classifier for document classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the class or topic of a document is arguably mainly expressed by nouns, verbs, and adjectives (and maybe adverbs). In contrast, function words such as determiners, prepositions, and pronouns, generally do not contribute to discriminating documents with respect to the class labels, since function words frequently appear in documents of all classes. It is therefore also common to perform stopword removal. This typically greatly reduces the total number of words in a document which reduces the number of required calculations.\n",

    "## Practical Application\n",
    "\n",
    "The code we have used so far for training a MNB classifier and making predictions focused on understanding the underlying calculations. The code also assumed text documents as input. In practice, the MNB classification algorithm is not limited to classifying text document but is applicable to any kind of multinomial data where a data sample (e.g., a text document) is described be the presence and absence of nominal features (e.g., words) and their number of occurrences. Furthermore, for practical applications, optimizing the runtime performance is an important consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MultinomialNB` class in the scikit-learn library implements the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. It is designed for data that can be represented as frequency counts, such as word occurrences in a document. The algorithm assumes that the features (e.g., words) are conditionally independent given the class and follows a multinomial distribution, which models the probability of observing specific frequencies of events. Key hyperparameters include `alpha`, which controls the level of smoothing (which we called $k$), and options for feature prior weights. The `fit()` method trains the model using labeled data, while methods like predict and predict_proba allow for making predictions and obtaining probability estimates for each class.\n",

    "### Creating a Feature Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MultinomialNB` class does not directly take text documents as input. The expected input format consists of two main components: the feature matrix `X` and the target vector `y`. The latter should be a 1-dimensional array-like structure containing the class labels for each sample in $X$. The class labels can be integers or strings, representing distinct categories for classification. We can therefore directly use `y_train` as it meets all the requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature matrix `X` should be a 2-dimensional array-like structure, where rows represent samples and columns represent features. The values in `X` must be non-negative, as the algorithm is designed to work with counts or frequencies, such as word occurrences in text classification tasks. Each row in `X` corresponds to a single sample, and each column represents a specific feature (e.g., a word in a vocabulary). The values in the matrix are typically integer counts or term frequencies, but they can also be non-negative real numbers if the features have been normalized (e.g., using TF-IDF). We therefore first need to convert our example dataset containing the seven sentences into this matrix representation\n",
    "\n",
    "The `CountVectorizer` class in scikit-learn is a feature extraction tool used to convert a collection of text documents into a matrix of token counts. It is commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks to prepare text data for machine learning models by representing text as numerical data. Each row of the resulting matrix corresponds to a document, while each column represents a token (usually a word or a sequence of words). The value at a specific cell in the matrix indicates the frequency of the token in the document. The code cell below uses the `CountVectorizer` class to calculate all the word counts for our example dataset. To visualize the matrix, we convert it into a Pandas DataFrame. Notice that we first transform the matrix to get the more common Term-Document Matrix, where the rows represent the terms/words and the columns represent the documents."

    "## Discussion & Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "The Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) classifier is a simple and efficient classification model, which can be very effective for handling text data for certain tasks. The MNB algorithm is computationally efficient, as it requires minimal resources to train and classify documents compared to more complex models. Its simplicity also ensures quick implementation and interpretability, which is useful for understanding how the model makes predictions. Another advantage is its robustness when working with sparse data, a common characteristic of text datasets. Since most documents contain only a small subset of the vocabulary, the classifier is designed to handle the sparsity of feature vectors effectively. While it may not capture complex relationships between words, its performance is often competitive on simpler tasks, especially when combined with techniques like n-grams or proper text preprocessing. In the following, we briefly discuss its limitations and potential mitigation strategies."

    "The independence assumption in the multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) classifier for document classification assumes that the features (e.g., words in a document) are conditionally independent given the class label. In simpler terms, it assumes that the occurrence of one word in a document does not depend on the occurrence of any other word, once the document's class is known. For example, if a document is labeled as *sport*, the model assumes that knowing the word *\"football\"* in the document provides no additional information about the likelihood of seeing the word *\"team\"* beyond the fact that the document is already classified as *sports*. Although this assumption does strictly speaking not hold, it is often acceptable in practice for multiple reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **High dimensionality of text data:** Text data is inherently high-dimensional, meaning documents typically contain many unique words. In such cases, exact dependencies between words are hard to model without overfitting. The independence assumption simplifies this complexity, making the model computationally efficient while still performing reasonably well.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Class conditional word distribution:** In document classification, the most important factor is the relative frequency of words in different classes. The multinomial Naive Bayes model captures this effectively. Even if the independence assumption is not strictly true, the model often succeeds because it focuses on capturing broad patterns rather than exact word relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Robustness in real-world applications:** Empirical studies show that the multinomial Naive Bayes classifier performs surprisingly well for tasks like spam filtering and sentiment analysis, despite its naive assumption. This is because in many text classification problems, the true dependencies between words do not critically affect classification accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This independence assumption has several advantages. Firstly, it greatly simplifies the calculations, as the model does not need to estimate the joint probabilities of all word combinations. This makes it fast and scalable to large datasets. Secondly, the simplicity of the model makes it easy to understand, implement, and train, even for non-experts. And lastly, in text classification, where most documents only contain a small subset of all possible words, the MNB model performs well because it focuses on capturing the most informative features.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the independence assumption may also result in an oversimplification of the word dependencies. Words in natural language often have dependencies (e.g., *\"New\"* and *\"York\"* frequently occur together). Ignoring these relationships can result in loss of information, potentially reducing accuracy. For tasks where the interaction between words is crucial (e.g., sarcasm detection or parsing ambiguous sentences, capturing negation for sentiment analysis), the independence assumption can significantly limit the model's ability to understand context. Also Since MNB does not model word dependencies, the choice of features (e.g., unigrams, bigrams &mdash; see below) becomes critical. Poor feature selection can lead to degraded performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, while the independence assumption in multinomial Naive Bayes is a simplification of reality, it strikes a balance between computational efficiency and classification accuracy, especially in high-dimensional and sparse text datasets. However, for more complex tasks requiring a nuanced understanding of language, advanced models like logistic regression or neural networks might be more suitable. Despite its limitations, the MNB classifier remains a popular choice for text classification tasks due to its simplicity, speed, and robustness in many practical scenarios."

    "### Beyond Unigrams\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, in all examples for using a MNB classifier to train a document classification model, we considered features to be individual words (i.e., unigrams). A common use case where this might negatively affect the model's performance is sentiment analysis. Consider the two simple sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *\"The movie was not boring because the cast was great.\"* (positive sentiment)\n",
    "* *\"The movie was boring because the cast was not great.\"* (negative sentiment)\n",
    "\n",
    "When using only unigrams, both sentences would yield the exact same posterior probabilities &mdash; since both sentences contain exactly the same words &mdash; and would therefore yield the same prediction. We therefore would like to somehow capture the connections between phrases such as *\"not boring\"* and *\"not great\"*. Fortunately, the MNB classification algorithm is completely agnostic about the \"nature\" of the nominal features. This means that, instead of limiting ourselves to word/unigrams, we can use n-grams as features, which itself only affects the preprocessing of the dataset and not the classifier itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this, let's look again at our example dataset containing seven sentences. However, notice that no stopword removal has been performed. Stopwords are typically not removed when extracting n-grams of size 2 or larger because they often play an important role in preserving the context and meaning of phrases. In n-grams, especially bigrams or trigrams, stopwords (e.g., *\"is\"*, *\"in\"*, *\"of\"*) can form part of meaningful expressions that provide critical information for text analysis. For example, in phrases like *\"out of stock\"* or *\"state of the art\"*, removing stop words would break these n-grams and lose their semantic value. These phrases are often highly predictive features in tasks like sentiment analysis or topic classification. Additionally, when working with n-grams, the inclusion of stopwords helps maintain the natural structure of the text, allowing the model to capture more realistic language patterns. Removing stop words could lead to incomplete or nonsensical n-grams that may be less useful as features. However, this decision depends on the specific task and dataset—if stopwords are highly frequent and do not contribute meaningful distinctions between classes, their removal might still be considered to reduce noise and dimensionality."

    "Recall that we only had 8 features when considering only unigrams as this was the size of our vocabulary &mdash; to be fair, this was without stopwords. Now, with all unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams, we have 137 features in total. This has both advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of n-gram size typically depends on the specific problem, dataset, and the balance between model complexity and performance. The main advantages of using larger n-grams are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Improved contextual representation:** Larger n-grams (bigrams, trigrams) capture the sequential context and relationships between words that unigrams might miss. For example, in sentiment analysis, a bigram like *\"not good\"* or a trigram like *\"not at all helpful\"* provides clear sentiment cues that the individual words (*\"not\"*, *\"good\"*, *\"helpful\"*) do not convey in isolation. This improved representation often leads to more accurate predictions in tasks where word order matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Disambiguation of meaning:** Larger n-grams can help disambiguate words that might have multiple meanings in different contexts. For example, *\"New York\"* as a bigram is distinct from the individual words *\"new\"* and *\"York\"*. This is particularly useful in tasks where preserving the meaning of multi-word expressions is critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Higher predictive power:** Since larger n-grams encode specific phrases and patterns, they often have higher discriminative power for classifying documents into distinct categories. For instance, phrases like *\"breaking news\"* or *\"artificial intelligence\"* are strong indicators of certain topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the flip, considering large(r) n-grams often poses challenges in practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Increased dimensionality:** Including larger n-grams significantly expands the feature space, as the number of possible n-grams grows exponentially with the size of the vocabulary and the n-gram length. This increased dimensionality can lead to higher computational costs, longer training times, and potentially memory issues, especially for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sparsity of data:** Larger n-grams tend to appear less frequently in documents, resulting in sparse feature representations. Sparsity can reduce the effectiveness of the MNB classifier, as it relies on sufficient occurrences of features to estimate probabilities reliably. Sparse features may also contribute little to classification and may need pruning.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Risk of overfitting:** When working with small datasets, larger n-grams can lead to overfitting, where the model memorizes specific patterns or phrases that are unique to the training set but do not generalize well to unseen data. This can harm the classifier's performance on new examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the choice of n-gram size requires balancing these factors. In practice, using a combination of n-gram sizes (e.g., unigrams and bigrams, or unigrams through trigrams) often yields good results by capturing both individual terms and meaningful word sequences. Additionally, techniques like feature selection (e.g., keeping only the top-k most frequent n-grams), regularization, and dimensionality reduction can mitigate the downsides of larger n-grams while preserving their benefits."

    "### Beyond Simple Counts\n",
    "\n",
    "The MNB classification algorithm assumes that the features (e.g., word counts) are generated from a multinomial distribution and interprets them as discrete probabilities. In terms of the Term-Document Matrix as the feature matrix as input, this means that all values are integer values representing the word counts; hence, the use of the `CountVectorizer` class in previous examples. However, the learning algorithm itself does not require the values in the feature matrix to be integer values but, in fact, accepts any kind of numerical values. This includes, for example, the Term-Document matrix with TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) weights. The intuition behind using TF-IDF  weights instead of simple counts in emphasizing the importance of words that are more informative and less frequent across the corpus. While word counts simply reflect how often a word appears in a document, they do not account for the fact that some words, such as stopwords (*\"the\"*, *\"is\"*, *\"and\"*), are very common and may not contribute much to distinguishing between classes &mdash; which is why stop words as unigrams are typically removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF weights aim to strike a balance between two factors. Firstly, the Term Frequency (TF) captures how frequently a word appears in a document. Higher frequency implies greater relevance within that document. This represents the basic word counts, but some implementations of TF-IDF might apply a monotonic function like the logarithm to scale its value. And secondly, the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) measures how unique a word is across the corpus. Words that appear in many documents (e.g., *\"show\"*, *\"step\"*, *\"good\"*) get lower weights, while rarer, more class-specific words (e.g., *\"quantum\"*, *\"electron\"*, or *\"gravity\"* in a physics-related dataset) are given higher weights. Very common stop words such *\"the\"*, *\"is\"*, *\"and\"*, and so on that virtually appear in all documents will, in fact, get a TF-IDF weight of $0$. By combining these two measures, TF-IDF reduces the impact of common words that provide little discriminatory power and highlights words that are more likely to indicate the document's class. This can have different advantages when using those weights when training a MNB classification model:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Improved feature discrimination:** With TF-IDF, the model gives more weight to words that are distinctive and less weight to ubiquitous terms that occur frequently but are less meaningful for classification. For example, in a spam detection task, the word *\"offer\"* might be more indicative of spam compared to *\"provide\"* which occurs in both spam and non-spam emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reduced noise:** Simple counts can inflate the importance of frequent but uninformative words, leading to noisy features that degrade the classifier's performance. TF-IDF mitigates this by penalizing such terms through the IDF component, making the feature set more meaningful for classification. This includes bigrams, trigrams, or generally n-grams beyond unigrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Balanced feature contribution:** TF-IDF helps avoid domination by long documents that naturally contain more word occurrences. By normalizing term weights, TF-IDF ensures that each document's feature vector is better scaled, improving the fairness of the classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its benefits, TF-IDF is not perfectly aligned with the assumptions of the MNB model. TF-IDF produces continuous, real-valued weights, which do not strictly satisfy this assumption of features generated from a multinomial distribution. While TF-IDF can still work well in practice with MNB, its use introduces a minor mismatch between the data representation and the model's theoretical foundation.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, TF-IDF produces continuous, real-valued weights, which do not strictly satisfy this assumption. While TF-IDF can still work well in practice with MNB, its use introduces a minor mismatch between the data representation and the model's theoretical foundation. In practice, TF-IDF is particularly useful when dealing with text datasets that contain a lot of common or irrelevant words. It is effective in cases where the discriminatory power of words needs to be highlighted. However, for datasets with highly distinctive terms or very short text, simple counts may suffice. Overall, TF-IDF can be a valid choice for improving the quality of feature representations and boosting the performance of the MNB algorithm for document classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "With existing libraries, using TF-IDF weights instead of simple word counts is very straightforward. For example, apart from the `CountVectorizer` class, the scikit-learn library also provides a `TfidfVectorizer` class to calculate the TF-IDF weights for a given training dataset of text documents. Again this class has an input parameter `ngram_range` to support n-grams of various sizes; see above. As a result, using TF-IDF weights instead of simple word counts requires to change only a single line &mdash; the first line of code in the code cell below &mdash; compared to our example using the `CountVectorizer` from before."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) algorithm is a probabilistic machine learning model widely used for document classification tasks such as spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and topic classification. It belongs to the family of Naive Bayes algorithms and is particularly well-suited for text data because it assumes that features follow a multinomial distribution. In this context, the features are typically word frequencies or occurrences derived from the documents, making MNB a natural fit for bag-of-words or term-frequency representations. The algorithm operates on the Bayes' theorem, which calculates the posterior probability of a class given a document based on the prior probability of the class and the likelihood of the document under that class. The \"naive\" assumption in Naive Bayes is that all features (e.g., words) are conditionally independent of each other given the class label. While this assumption is often violated in real-world text data, the model still performs surprisingly well in many applications due to its simplicity and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "MNB computes the likelihood of a document belonging to a class by analyzing the frequency of words in the document and comparing it to the word distributions in the training data for each class. Specifically, it estimates the probability of each word occurring in each class using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with additive smoothing (commonly Laplace smoothing) to handle words that may not appear in the training data. This ensures the algorithm can handle unseen words gracefully and avoids assigning zero probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key advantages of Multinomial Naive Bayes is its computational efficiency, as it requires minimal resources to train and predict. It works well with high-dimensional data, such as text corpora, and scales effectively to large datasets. However, it assumes that all features contribute equally to the outcome, which can sometimes limit its performance when more complex patterns exist in the data. Additionally, MNB is sensitive to how the text is preprocessed (e.g., tokenization, stop-word removal, or n-gram representation) and typically works better with normalized features like term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). In summary, Multinomial Naive Bayes is a robust, simple-to-implement algorithm for text classification that balances performance and computational efficiency. Its effectiveness in real-world applications, despite its simplicity, has made it a cornerstone of many NLP pipelines, especially in situations where interpretability and speed are critical."
