    "# Subword Tokenization (WordPiece)\n",
    "\n",
    "The WordPiece algorithm is a widely used method for subword tokenization, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Originally introduced for speech recognition, WordPiece gained prominence with its use in pre-trained language models such as BERT. The algorithm addresses key challenges in text representation, such as handling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and efficiently representing rare words, by breaking text into subword units instead of relying solely on full words or individual characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, WordPiece seeks to build a vocabulary of subword units by balancing frequency and efficiency. The algorithm begins with an initial vocabulary consisting of individual characters and iteratively merges pairs of tokens that maximize the likelihood of the training data. This likelihood is computed based on the frequency of token pairs and their impact on the overall representation. The result is a compact vocabulary that includes common words as single units and decomposes rare or complex words into smaller, meaningful subword components. For example, a word like *\"unbelievable\"* might be tokenized into [*\"un\"*, *\"##believable\"*], where the *\"##\"* prefix indicates that the subword is part of a larger word.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key strengths of WordPiece is its ability to balance generalization and specificity. By using subwords, the algorithm can effectively handle new words that were not seen during training by combining known subword units. This property reduces the OOV problem and enables models to better understand rare words or morphologically rich languages. Additionally, subword tokenization allows for smaller vocabulary sizes compared to full-word tokenization, which reduces memory requirements and computational costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "WordPiece has become a cornerstone in modern NLP pipelines due to its efficiency and adaptability. It enables pre-trained language models to achieve state-of-the-art performance across various tasks, including text classification, machine translation, and question answering. Its design, which merges data-driven insights with linguistic intuition, has inspired other tokenization algorithms like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and SentencePiece. As a result, WordPiece continues to be an essential component in advancing NLP technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will take a closer look at the WordPiece algorithm and implement a basic WordPiece tokenizer from scratch in a step-by-step and illustrative manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The two subword tokenization algorithms WordPiece and Byte-Pair Encoding are very similar. Since BPE is arguably slightly simpler, and we occasionally refer to BPE in this notebook &mdash; to highlight the fundamental difference between WordPiece and BPE &mdash; we recommend first reading up on BPE. However, this is not required to understand how WordPiece works, only to appreciate how it compares to BPE."

    "#### Token Merging Step\n",
    " \n",
    "The key idea of WordPiece is to iteratively merge the most frequent token pairs in the corpus state to build a vocabulary that efficiently represents the structure of the input text. The goal is to identify and represent commonly occurring patterns &mdash; such as subwords, roots, prefixes, or suffixes &mdash; with single tokens. This reduces the number of tokens needed to encode the text while maintaining flexibility for representing rare or unseen words through combinations of smaller subword units.\n",
    "\n",
    "By iteratively merging the most frequent adjacent token pairs, WordPiece strikes a balance between character-level and word-level tokenization. Character-level tokenization ensures coverage for any text but can result in extremely long sequences that are computationally expensive to process. On the other hand, word-level tokenization creates inefficiencies when encountering rare words, as each unique word would need a separate token. WordPiece bridges this gap by creating a subword-level tokenization scheme: frequent word components are merged into single tokens, while rare or out-of-vocabulary words can still be represented as sequences of smaller subword units.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Calculate Number of Token Pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "WordPiece and BPE follow a very similar bottom-up approach by first splitting words into character tokens and then iteratively finding the next best pair of tokens to be merged tokens into a new larger token. While there are minor differences in the general setup, both algorithms fundamentally only differ in the criterion they use to find the next token pair to merge. BPE simply picks the token pair with the most occurrences in the corpus state. For example, assuming the initial corpus state from above, BPE calculates the number of occurrences of *\"l _o\"*, *\"_o _w\"*, *\"_w _e\"*, *\"_e _r\"*, *\"n _e\"*, and so on, and then merges the token pair with the highest number of occurrences (randomly breaking ties).\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to BPE, WordPiece does not choose the most frequent token pair, but the one that maximizes the likelihood of the training data once added to the vocabulary. The likelihood of a token pair $(t_1, t_2)$ is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large\n",
    "\\frac{P(t_1, t_2)}{P(t_1) P(t_2)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P(t_1, t_2)$ is the probability of seeing the token pair $(t_1, t_2)$ given the corpus, $P(t_1)$ is the probability of seeing token $t_1$ in the corpus, $P(t_2)$ is the probability of seeing token $t_2$ in the corpus. In other words, we need to calculate the likelihoods for all token pairs in our current token pairs and pick the one with the highest likelihood. While we could calculate all three probabilities to get the likelihood, let's see how we can simplify this formula. First, we can apply the formula for conditional probabilities $P(B|A) = P(B,A)P(A)$ for two random events $A$ and $B$. With $A$ and $B$ being our two tokens $t_1$ and $t_2$, we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large\n",
    "\\frac{P(t_1, t_2)}{P(t_1) P(t_2)} = \\frac{P(t_2|t_1)P(t_1)}{P(t_1) P(t_2)} = \\frac{P(t_2|t_1)}{P(t_2)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of n-gram language models, $P(t_2)$ is the unigram probability for token $t_2$, and $P(t_2|t_1)$ is the bigram probability for the token sequence/pair $(t_2,t_1)$. We can therefore calculate both probabilities as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large\n",
    "P(t_2) = \\frac{count(t_2)}{N}\\ , \\quad P(t_2|t_1) = \\frac{count(t_1,t_2)}{count(t_1)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N$ is the total number of tokens in the current corpus state, $count(t_1,t_2$ is the total number of occurrences of token pair $(t_1,t_2)$, $count(t_1)$ is the total number of occurrences of token $t_1$, and $count(t_1)$ is the total number of occurrences of token $t_2$. Plugging these term into our initial formula, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large\n",
    "\\frac{P(t_1, t_2)}{P(t_1) P(t_2)} = \\frac{P(t_2|t_1)}{P(t_2)} = \\frac{\\frac{count(t_1,t_2)}{count(t_1)}}{\\frac{count(t_2)}{N}} = \\frac{N\\cdot count(t_1,t_2)}{count(t_1)\\cdot count(t_2)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, compared to BPE, we not only need to calculate the number of occurrences of each token pair $(t_1, t_2)$, but also the number of occurrences of the two component tokens $t_1$ and $t_2$. As a last little improvement, consider that we are not really interested in the exact likelihood values, but only want to find the token pair with the largest likelihood. Notice that the number of tokens $N$ does not depend on a current token pair, and therefore does not affect the final ranking of token pairs. This allows us to simply ignore $N$ in the calculation. Of course this means that the likelihood is not only proportional to the final formula\n",

    "\n",
    "The method `find_best_token_pair()` in the code cell below implements this calculation by iterating over all token sequences in the corpus state, and for each sequence, iterating over all to sum up the total number of occurrences of each token pair and each individual token. The method then calculates the score for each token pair, where the score is proportional to the pair's likelihood and calculated by the formula given above. The method finally returns the token pair with the highest (any ties are broken randomly). The method also returns a dictionary with all token pairs and their respective scores; this is only to have a look at the scores and not need for the algorithm itself."

Since the corpus state is implemented as a dictionary and replacing all occurrences of the token pair with the merge token means changing the keys of this dictionary, we cannot simply iterate over this dictionary and directly change the keys. We therefore break this update step up into two loops\n",

For example, given the key *\"l _o _n _g _e _r\"*, the Regular Expression looking for *\"_n _g\"* would match; but would not match for *\"n _e _w _e _s _t\"*. We keep track of all matching keys using the dictionary `matches` where its keys are the old keys in corpus state and the values are the new keys for the corpus state. We use the same Regular Expression to generate the new keys; for example, *\"l _o _n _g _e _r\"* becomes *\"l _o _ng _e _r\"*.\n",

    "### WordPiece vs. BPE &mdash; Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Since WordPiece and BPE fundamentally only differ with respect to how the next token pair for merging is determined, it is a good time to try to get some intuition behind that difference. Recall the the score for a token pair $(t_1, t_2)$ in WordPiece is computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large\n",
    "\\frac{count(t_1,t_2)}{count(t_1)\\cdot count(t_2)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, BPE only uses $count(t_1,t_2)$! This means that WordPiece will favor a token pair even if it is *\"not\"* the most frequent. More specifically, WordPiece favors token pairs where the two tokens, if they appear in a word, very often appear together. For example, given our toy dataset, the token pair (*\"_n\"*, *\"_g\"*) appears only once in the corpus state, while, e.g., (*\"_e\"*, *\"_s\"*) nine times (and would therefore be chosen by BPE). However, both tokens *\"_n\"* and *\"_g\"* happen to appear only once. In simple terms, this means that when we see the token *\"_n\"* we are very likely see it together with token *\"_g\"*, and vice versa. In other words, the higher the score of a token pair, the more frequently both tokens co-occur than would be expected under an assumption of both tokens being independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or just by dissecting the formula above, the score is high if the numerator (the count of the token pair) is large and the denominator (the product of the two token counts) is small. Of course, the following two inequalities $count(t_1,t_2) \\leq count(t_1)$ and $count(t_1,t_2) \\leq count(t_1)$ always hold. Thus, the maximum score for a token pair is $1$. Therefore, for the denominator to be as small as possible, the two tokens of a token pair may have as few other token pairs as possible (or as an individual). The more often one or both tokens appear \"outside\" that pair, the lower the score."

Although the implementation of this method is rather straightforward, three small details are worth mentioning\n",
    "\n",
    "* One of the aforementioned advantages of WordPiece is that we can specify the maximum size of the resulting vocabulary. Since each merging step adds a new token to the vocabulary, we can restrict the size of the vocabulary by limiting the number of merging steps. However, since our initial vocabulary is not empty but the set of all unique characters, the number of merging steps &mdash; that is, the number of iterations `num_iter` in the code &mdash; derives from the difference of the specified maximum vocabulary size `max_vocab_size` and the size of the initial vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In principle, particularly if the corpus is not very large, the algorithm might perform more merges than possible. This happens when all words in the corpus state have been merged to their original form. For example, after a certain amount of iterations, say, *\"n _e _w _e _s _t\"* will have been merged to \"newest\". If this is true for all words in the corpus state, the corpus state does no longer contain any pair of tokens. In this case, the method `find_best_token_pair()` will throw an error and exit the loop since the learning algorithm has finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In each iteration, we keep track of the recent merge by adding it to a list of all previous merges. This list of merges is in fact the most important return value of the learning algorithm as it is used for tokenizing text. This includes that the order matters as we want to merge tokens in a new text in the same order as we merged them during the learning phase."

This includes that we first perform pretokenization and treat each initial token separately. The method `tokenize_word()` tokenizes a single (initial) token based on the learned list of merges as follows:\n",

For example, the merge `(\"_e _r\", \"_er\")` will find a match in *\"n _e _w _e _r\"* and convert it the *\"n _e _w _er\"*.

    "## Discussion & Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Representation of tokens:** In our implementation, the tokens in the corpus state are represented as their actual strings of characters. The advantage is that it is much easier to follow how the algorithm works. Practical applications, however, commonly represent the tokens as unique ids, and the vocabulary maintains a mapping between the ids and their respective tokens. For example, instead of representing and entry in the corpus state like\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "  \"wid _e _st\": 3,\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "the alternative representation using ids could look like\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "  \"230 4 108\": 3,\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $230$ maps to *\"wid\"*, $4$ to *\"_e\"*, and $108$ to *\"_st\"*. Thus, every time a token pair gets merged into a new token, a new id gets created for that token. This approach has a couple advantages. Firstly, the implementation in terms of memory management gets easier since integer values have a fixed size in bytes, whereas string tokens vary in size during the learning when the token gets merged. And secondly, token ids are the \"natural\" input for most machine learning algorithms, incl. neural networks. It is therefore more efficient if the tokenizer directly outputs a list of ids. If needed, ids can always be decoded using the mapping between ids and string tokens maintained in the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Special characters:** For our example implementation we used the underscore `_` as a special character to mark the continuation of a word. We saw that this was needed to reconstruct a list of tokens into a proper text. We already mentioned that the choice of `_` was simply to ease the representation, but we had to make the assumption that the training data does not contain underscores. In real-world text corpora, of course, underscores might very well occur. Therefore, practical WordPiece tokenizer algorithms favor characters that are arbitrarily unlikely to appear in a text document. For example, the common BERT tokenizer uses **##** as a special character (sequence) for the tokenizer; whether a single character or a sequence of characters is used to mark the continuation of a word does not affect the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Smart(er) pretokenization:** WordPiece &mdash; as well as most other subword tokenization algorithms &mdash; requires a pretokenization to an initial list of tokens to initialize the corpus state. For English and many other languages, doing this by breaking up a text with respect to whitespace characters, is a quick and simple approach &mdash; and it works, as we have seen throughout the notebook. However, it is very common in English that there is no whitespace between tokens of different categories. For example, there is no whitespace before punctuation marks, and no whitespace before/after a closing/opening parenthesis or quote character. Simple whitespace pretokenization therefore yields initial tokens that do not \"belong together\". For example, an initial corpus state might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "  \"w _i _d _e _s _t _.\": 30,\n",
    "  \"w _i _d _e _s _t _?\": 16,\n",
    "  \"w _i _d _e _s _t _!\": 9,\n",
    "  \"w _i _d _e _s _t _,\": 3,\n",
    "  \"w _i _d _e _s _t _:\": 5,\n",
    "  \"w _i _d _e _s _t _;\": 10,\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While, in principle, WordPiece still works, it might lead to suboptimal allocation of limited vocabulary slots. For example, with this corpus state, both *\"_st?\"* and *\"_st!\"* (and maybe others) might make it into the vocabulary although both tokens are from the perspective of a word they are the same. and model capacity. To avoid this, practical WordPiece implementations use some smarter pretokenization to the learning algorithm from merging across character categories. For example, with a pretokenizer that splits words from punctuation marks, our corpus state from above might look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "  \"w _i _d _e _s _t\": 73,\n",
    "  \".\": 10085,\n",
    "  \"?\": 3120,\n",
    "  \"!\": 5467,\n",
    "  \",\": 8985,\n",
    "  \":\": 1403,\n",
    "  \";\": 2050,\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To give a concrete example, GPT2 used the following Regular Expression the pretokenize input texts (note: the expression has be slightly adapted to fit its use in this notebook, and later GPT uses more revised expression; however, here it's only used to show an alternative to naive whitespace pretokenization)."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "WordPiece is a subword tokenization algorithm widely used in natural language processing (NLP) to handle the challenges of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and create efficient representations of text. Unlike word-level tokenization, which struggles with rare or novel words, and character-level tokenization, which loses semantic context, WordPiece breaks words into smaller, meaningful subword units. It begins with an initial vocabulary of characters and iteratively merges the most frequent token pairs in a corpus until a specified vocabulary size is reached. This approach ensures that both frequent and rare words are effectively represented, making WordPiece a cornerstone of modern NLP systems like BERT and its variants.\n",
    "\n",
    "WordPiece is crucial for enabling language models to generalize across diverse text inputs. By tokenizing words into known subunits, it allows models to process rare or unseen words without losing their semantic meaning. For example, a word like *\"unhappiness\"* might be split into *\"un\"*, *\"happy\"*, and \"*ness\"*, capturing its structure and meaning. WordPiece is especially effective in multilingual and morphologically rich languages, where it can create shared subword representations across languages. Its applications include machine translation, sentiment analysis, question answering, and more, where robust tokenization is essential for high model performance. Its main advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **OOV handling:** WordPiece effectively tokenizes rare or novel words into smaller, meaningful components, preventing issues with OOV words.\n",
    "* **Compact vocabulary:** The algorithm creates a vocabulary that balances granularity and efficiency, reducing memory and computational requirements.\n",
    "* **Multilingual support:** Shared subwords across languages make WordPiece well-suited for multilingual models like mBERT.\n",
    "* **Improved Generalization:** By focusing on statistically significant subword units, WordPiece supports better model performance across domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, WordPiece also has some limitations or potential problems, mainly:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Computational overhead:** The iterative merging process during training can be computationally expensive for large corpora.\n",
    "* **Over-fragmentation:** Small vocabulary sizes can lead to overly fragmented tokenization, potentially obscuring word-level semantic meaning.\n",
    "* **Dependence on corpus:** WordPiece relies heavily on the training corpus, making the vocabulary less adaptable to new domains or specialized datasets.\n",
    "* **Interpretability:** Subword tokenization can result in less human-interpretable token sequences, particularly in text generation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "WordPiece strikes a balance between character- and word-level tokenization, offering an efficient and effective solution for modern NLP challenges. Despite its limitations, its ability to handle OOV words, create compact vocabularies, and support multilingual processing has made it indispensable in the development of state-of-the-art NLP models. However, careful tuning of vocabulary size and corpus selection is essential to maximize its benefits while mitigating its drawbacks."
