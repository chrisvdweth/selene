    "## Word2Vec\n",
    "\n",
    "In natural language processing, most algorithms require numerical representations of text, yet raw words carry no inherent meaning for a computer. Early approaches relied on sparse, high-dimensional representations such as one-hot encodings or bag-of-words vectors, which fail to capture semantic relationships and scale poorly with vocabulary size. This limitation motivated the development of dense word embeddings: compact numerical vectors that encode meaningful linguistic patterns. Word2Vec was one of the first approaches to demonstrate that simple neural models can learn powerful word representations purely from co-occurrence patterns in large corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind **Word2Vec** is to train a shallow neural network to predict words from their contexts or vice versa. Through this prediction task, the model adjusts its internal weights in such a way that words appearing in similar linguistic environments end up with similar vectors. Word2Vec comes in two main variants: **Continuous Bag-of-Words** (predict the target from its neighboring words) and **Skip-gram** (predict neighboring words from the target). An optimized version, **Skip-gram with Negative Sampling** (SGNS), further speeds up training while preserving high-quality embeddings. These methods produce embeddings that naturally capture analogies, clusters, and linear subspaces that correspond to semantic and syntactic relations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, Word2Vec offers several advantages. It is fast, scalable, and easy to train even on large datasets, and the resulting embeddings are remarkably effective for many tasks, from similarity search to clustering and feature extraction. The learned vectors generalize well, often encoding meaningful relationships without explicit supervision. This simplicity and interpretability made Word2Vec a cornerstone technique in early neural NLP and a standard baseline for many applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Word2Vec also has important limitations. It produces **static embeddings**, meaning each word type has a single vector regardless of context. This becomes problematic for polysemous words or tasks requiring fine-grained understanding, where different meanings should be distinguished. Word2Vec also cannot naturally handle out-of-vocabulary tokens and depends heavily on preprocessing choices and the domain of the training data. These limitations eventually motivated the shift toward contextual embeddings in modern transformer-based models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we cover Word2Vec in detail, how the method works at a conceptual level, and what its practical strengths and weaknesses are. Understanding these foundations helps build intuition for both classical NLP techniques and the more advanced contextual models that followed. In a separate notebook, we are more hands-on and train Word2Vec embeddings from scratch. However, understanding the key ideas behind Word2Vec helps to follow the steps of training embedding vectors."

    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "On a very basic level, raw text is not a very convenient form of data as it does not fit naturally into the input requirements of most machine learning models. For one, text is inherently **variable in length**: sentences, paragraphs, and documents can contain any number of words, and each word itself is a **discrete symbol** rather than a numeric value. By contrast, many machine learning algorithms assume fixed-size, numerical input vectors. A second major issue is that machines have no built-in understanding of similarity between words. To an algorithm, the words *\"cat\"*, *\"dog\"*, and *\"car\"* are simply unrelated identifiers unless meaningful relationships are engineered or learned. However, many ML models rely on or benefit from inputs that reflect semantic or syntactic similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings address this by learning a representation in which words that appear in similar contexts receive similar vectors. This transforms nominal linguistic symbols into structured numerical data, enabling algorithms to exploit the underlying relationships that humans intuitively recognize. For example, in **text classification** tasks like sentiment analysis or topic detection, embeddings allow classifiers to generalize across related terms, like recognizing that *\"excellent\"*, *\"great\"*, and *\"fantastic\"* express similar sentiment, even if some of them appear rarely in the training data. In **information retrieval** or **semantic search**, embeddings make it possible to retrieve documents containing semantically related words rather than requiring exact keyword matches, improving both recall and relevance. Embeddings also help in tasks such as **named-entity recognition**, **machine translation**, and **part-of-speech tagging**, where understanding the contextual or functional similarity of words is essential. Because word embeddings cluster related words and capture syntactic patterns, models can more easily identify entities, align words across languages, or infer grammatical roles. Overall, embeddings provide a compact way to encode linguistic structure, enabling downstream models to learn more effectively with less data and better generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, converting words into embedding vectors that capture meaningful semantics is not straightforward because words are inherently **abstract and context-dependent**. A word's meaning often varies depending on usage, surrounding words, or domain, and many words are polysemous, carrying multiple senses. Simply assigning arbitrary vectors to words provides no information about their relationships or similarities, so the challenge lies in learning representations that reflect both syntactic and semantic structure purely from observed text. Unlike images or audio, where local structure and patterns can be directly quantified, the \"meaning\" of a word is **latent** and must be inferred indirectly through context, co-occurrence, and distributional patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the space of language is **high-dimensional, sparse, and highly combinatorial**, making it difficult to encode all relevant nuances in a fixed-size vector. Words interact in complex ways: analogies, idiomatic expressions, and subtle stylistic differences can all change the meaning or function of a word in a sentence. Capturing these patterns requires models to summarize enormous amounts of co-occurrence information while balancing the trade-off between generality and specificity. This complexity is what makes learning word embeddings a non-trivial task and motivates methods like Word2Vec, GloVe, and later contextual embeddings, which leverage statistical patterns in text to generate vectors that encode meaningful semantic relationships."

    "### Distributional Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Distributional Hypothesis** is the core linguistic idea behind word embeddings like Word2Vec. It states that *words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings*. In other words, you can infer what a word means by looking at the company it keeps: if two words frequently appear next to the same neighboring words, they are likely to be semantically related. This hypothesis goes back to work by linguists such as Zellig Harris and J.R. Firth (*\"You shall know a word by the company it keeps\"*) and provides a purely data-driven way to capture meaning without handcrafted rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate idea, consider the following four sentences containing the word *\"bobotie\"*; and let's assume you do not know this word:\n",
    "* *\"When I was in South Africa, I had <font color=\"red\">**bobotie**</font> almost every day.\"*\n",
    "* *\"We all had <font color=\"red\">**bobotie**</font> for dinner last night.\"*\n",
    "* *\"Although not particularly spicy, <font color=\"red\">**bobotie**</font> incorporates a variety of flavours\"*\n",
    "* *\"The first recipe for <font color=\"red\">**bobotie**</font> appeared in a Dutch cookbook in 1609\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "Even without knowing the bobotie is a traditional South African dish, just from these sentences alone, it is easy to tell that it is very likely \"some\" dish, meal, or food. Particularly context words such as *\"dinner\"*, \"*spicy*\", *\"flavours\"*, *\"recipe\"*, and *\"cookbook\"* are arguably giving string hints. Furthermore, we could, at least in principle, substitute *\"bobotie\"* with, say, *\"stew\"* and all sentences would still be meaningful &mdash; at least semantically when ignoring facts such as the last sentence. This means that *\"bobotie\"* and *\"stew\"* are considered similar words in the context of the Distributional Hypothesis and should be represented by similar embedding vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embedding models operationalize this idea by **learning vector representations** that reflect these context similarities. Word2Vec, for instance, trains neural networks to predict a word from its surrounding context (CBOW) or the context from a word (Skip-gram). In doing so, words that appear in similar contexts get pushed toward similar positions in the embedding space. The result is a geometric encoding where semantic relationships such as similarity, analogy, or category structure, emerge purely from distributional patterns in text. So let's dive into how Word2Vec is doing this."

    "## Word2Vec Architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec is not a single implementation but is best understood as a family of closely related embedding architectures rather than a single, fixed algorithm. While the goal is always to learn dense vector representations that capture semantic relationships between words, there are multiple ways to frame the prediction task that drives this learning. The two main variants &mdash; **CBOW (Continuous Bag-of-Words)** and **Skip-gram** &mdash; approach the problem from opposite directions: CBOW predicts a target word from its surrounding context, while Skip-gram predicts surrounding context words from a target word. Each formulation captures slightly different statistical properties of language, leading to differences in computational efficiency, performance on rare versus frequent words, and suitability for specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond CBOW and Skip-gram, Word2Vec includes additional implementation choices such as hierarchical softmax, negative sampling, and subsampling of frequent words. These are not superficial tweaks but fundamentally influence model behavior, training speed, and the structure of the learned embeddings. Because natural language has rich, multi-scale patterns, no single configuration is universally optimal. Instead, Word2Vec provides a toolbox of compatible variants, allowing practitioners to tailor the model to their data size, vocabulary distribution, and performance goals. In the following, we focus on the two main variants CBOW and Skip-gram, as well as the optimized version Skip-gram with Negative Sampling."

    "### Basic Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In its core, Word2Vec is implemented as a word classification task where the goal is to train a model that can predict word relationships based on their contexts. The figure below illustrates the general architecture assuming a single word as input and a single word as output. The Word2Vec model can be implemented as a shallow neural network contain one hidden layer &mdash; represented by input weight matrix $\\mathbf{U}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{|V|\\times d}$ &mdash; and one output layer &mdash; represented by input weight matrix $\\mathbf{V}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{d\\times |V|}$. Here, $V$ represents the vocabulary, i.e., the set of the unique words; naturally, $|V|$ is the size of the vocabulary, i.e., the number of unique words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The embedding size $d$ is the dimensionality of the embedding vector used to represent each word, and it determines how much information the embedding can encode. A larger $d$ gives the model more capacity to capture nuanced semantic and syntactic relationships between words, potentially improving performance on downstream tasks &mdash; but it also increases the number of parameters, the risk of overfitting, and the computational cost. A smaller $d$ produces more compact embeddings that train faster and may generalize better on small datasets, but they might lack the expressive power needed to distinguish subtle word relationships. In practice, the optimal embedding size depends on dataset size, model complexity, and task requirements. Common pretrained Word2Vec models typically use embedding sizes of $100$, $200$, or $300$ dimensions, with $300$ being the most widely used configuration (e.g., the original Google News Word2Vec model). These values represent a practical balance: large enough to capture meaningful semantic structure, but small enough to train efficiently and avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This classification setup is essential because it enables Word2Vec to learn **semantic word embeddings** indirectly through prediction. By training to correctly classify words in context, the model adjusts its internal word vectors, captured by $\\mathbf{U}$ and $\\mathbf{V}$ so that words appearing in similar contexts have similar representations. Thus, while Word2Vec's ultimate goal is not classification per se, framing it as such provides a simple and effective learning objective for capturing the statistical structure of language."

    "In the **Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW)** setup of Word2Vec, the model predicts a **target word** (or **center word**) based on its surrounding **context words**. Given a window of text (for example, two words to the left and two to the right), CBOW averages or sums the embeddings of the context words and feeds this combined representation into a classifier that tries to guess the missing central word. Because the input is an unordered \"bag\" of context words, CBOW does not consider word order, which simplifies the model and speeds up training. For example, in the sentence *\"We were watching funny movies on Netflix last weekend\"*, if the window size is $2$ and the target word is *\"movies\"*, the context words would be *\"watching\"*, *\"funny\"*, *\"on\"*, and *\"Netflix\"* (again, CBOW ignores the actual order)."

    "In terms of architecture, the CBOW model is a shallow neural network with one hidden layer. To give an example, the class `CBOW` in the code cell below is a straightforward implementation of the CBOW architecture as shown in the figure about using PyTorch. The model contains the implementations of the two weight matrices $\\mathbf{U}$ and $\\mathbf{V}$. Notice that the input weight matrix $\\mathbf{U}$ is implemented using a `nn.Embedding` layer. This avoids the need to convert each word index into its respective one-hot vector. The class also performs the computation of the loss. The [**`nn.CrossEntropyLoss`**](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html) is a commonly used loss function for multi-class classification tasks. It combines **`nn.LogSoftmax`** and **`nn.NLLLoss`** (negative log-likelihood loss) in a single step. Because [`nn.CrossEntropyLoss`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html) internally applies the log-softmax operation, the inputs to the loss function are raw scores (logits) rather than probabilities."

Again, the order of the context words does not matter. The model architecture of SKip-gram is very similar to CBOW; see the figure below.

    "**CBOW vs. Skip-gram.**  Despite their close relationship, in practice, CBOW and Skip-gram tend to produce *slightly different types of word embeddings*, but most of the differences are empirical observations rather than strict theoretical guarantees. CBOW predicts a target word from its surrounding context, which effectively averages the context information. Because of this averaging, CBOW is faster to train, more stable, and works better on large datasets, especially for learning good representations of frequent words. In contrast, Skip-gram predicts the surrounding words from a target word, which means it sees many more training examples for each word. This makes Skip-gram slower but tends to yield better representations for rare words, because every training instance focuses on a single central word instead of a blurred context window; it is also better at capturing fine-grained semantic relationships.

    "### Skip-gram with Negative Sampling (SGNS)\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic Skip-gram model tries to predict every context word in a window using a full softmax over the entire vocabulary. While conceptually simple, this is computationally expensive because each training step requires computing scores for *all* vocabulary items, which can easily be millions of words. This makes vanilla Skip-gram impractical for large corpora and leads to very slow training. Moreover, many of the predicted context words are actually uninformative for learning meaningful embeddings, since most words in the vocabulary are not relevant exceptions for any given training example. For example, determiners (*\"a\"*, *\"an\"*), conjunctions (*\"and\"*, *\"or\"*, *\"but\"*, etc.), or prepositions (*\"to\"*, *\"from\"*, *\"up\"*, etc.) are words that appear in the contexts of basically all words.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Skip-gram with Negative Sampling (SGNS)** addresses these issues by replacing the full softmax with a binary classification task: the model learns to distinguish real context words from a small number of artificially sampled \"negative\" words (i.e., **negative samples**). Instead of comparing the target word to the entire vocabulary, SGNS compares it only to a handful of negative samples, making each update dramatically faster. This allows training on huge datasets while still pushing embeddings of related words closer and unrelated words further apart. Thus, for our example center word and corresponding context words, the positive samples together with \"some\" negative sample would look conceptually as follows:"

    "Word2Vec embeddings provide compact, efficient representations by mapping each word to a low-dimensional dense vector instead of a sparse, high-dimensional one-hot encoding. This makes them inexpensive to store and fast to use while still capturing rich linguistic information. Because information is distributed across dimensions, embeddings can generalize smoothly: words that appear in similar contexts end up with similar vectors, even if they rarely co-occur directly. They are also robust to noise and variability in language use. By aggregating contextual evidence across many occurrences, Word2Vec forms stable, context-invariant representations that reflect the dominant meaning of a word rather than idiosyncratic or rare usages. This smoothness and robustness make the embeddings practical and reliable inputs for a wide range of NLP tasks."

The left figure shows similar analogies using the relation between countries as capitals as an example.

    "The underlying intuition is that Word2Vec is trained to preserve patterns of word co-occurrence: words that appear in similar contexts are close together, and systematic contextual differences induce consistent offsets. When a semantic attribute (like gender or tense) affects word usage in a regular way across many word pairs, the model can encode this attribute as a roughly linear factor in the embedding space. As a result, analogical reasoning reduces to linear algebra, and entire families of analogies can be captured by projecting word vectors onto the corresponding subspace. This linear structure is not explicitly enforced during training, but emerges naturally from the objective and the distributional regularities of language.\n",
    "\n",
    "The existence of linear subspaces and consistent relation vectors in Word2Vec embeddings indicates that the individual dimensions are not arbitrary, but jointly organize semantic information in a structured way. Although no single dimension corresponds directly to an interpretable concept like *\"gender\"* or *\"tense\"* these concepts are nonetheless encoded as *directions* or combinations of dimensions. If the dimensions were purely meaningless or random, we would not observe stable, reusable displacement vectors such as $king − man \\approx queen − woman$ across many word pairs. The fact that such relations generalize implies that semantic attributes are distributed across dimensions and can be recovered through linear operations, revealing that the embedding space has a coherent internal geometry shaped by meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This phenomenon reflects the idea of *distributed representations*: semantics is encoded in patterns across many dimensions rather than in isolated coordinates. Each dimension may contribute weakly to multiple semantic factors, but together they form subspaces that correspond to meaningful linguistic properties. As a result, while individual axes lack an intuitive 1:1 interpretation, the embedding as a whole supports semantically meaningful computations like analogy solving, clustering, and similarity measurement. The emergence of linear structure therefore provides strong evidence that word embeddings capture latent semantic factors, even when these factors are only interpretable at the level of vector combinations rather than single dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** Despite their appeal, linear subspaces and vector arithmetic in Word2Vec are only approximate phenomena rather than strict algebraic rules. Many analogies work well, but a substantial number fail or produce unstable results depending on the vocabulary, training data, embedding dimension, or similarity metric used. Even for commonly cited relations like gender or tense, the corresponding direction is often noisy and entangled with other semantic factors. As a result, operations such as $a − b + c$ do not reliably yield the expected word $d$, and small changes in the input words or model can lead to different or less interpretable outcomes. These observations suggest that analogy-solving via vector arithmetic should be seen as an emergent statistical regularity, not as a precise compositional mechanism. Language is highly polysemous and context-dependent, and many relations between words are not uniform across all instances or domains. Consequently, semantic relations may not lie in clean, low-dimensional subspaces, but instead overlap and interfere with one another. The success of linear analogies therefore highlights useful structure in embedding spaces, while their frequent failures remind us that this structure is imperfect and that word embeddings provide an approximate, distribution-driven representation of meaning rather than a complete semantic model."

Let's look at some of those considerations and limitations a bit more closely."

These models have no built-in understanding of language; instead, they infer semantic and syntactic relationships by observing which words tend to co-occur. If the dataset is biased toward specific topics, writing styles, or domains, the learned embeddings will reflect those patterns. For example, embeddings trained on biomedical texts will capture technical, domain-specific relationships that differ substantially from embeddings trained on news articles, literature, or social media.\n",

Overall both rankings look good since all listed words are indeed semantically similar to *\"house\"*. However, there are differences in the rankings.

    "### Preprocessing Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing choices significantly influence the quality and behavior of word embeddings because they determine what the model sees as a \"word\", how consistently tokens appear, and what linguistic distinctions are preserved. When preparing a raw text corpus to serve as a training dataset for a word embedding model, there are various design decisions you have to make that will affect the resulting embeddings. Here are some of the most relevant considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Choice of tokenizer.** The tokenizer governs how text is split into units; simple whitespace tokenizers may merge punctuation with words or mishandle compound terms, while more sophisticated tokenizers can better capture linguistic structure. For tasks involving noisy text (e.g., social media), tokenizers that handle emojis, URLs, or slang may yield more informative embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Case-folding.** The conversion of a that all lowercase letters/characters reduces sparsity by merging variants like *\"Apple\"* and *\"apple\"*, but it also removes distinctions that may matter in specific domains such as named-entity-heavy corpora (news, biomedical, legal). For example, converting the company name *\"Apple\"* to lowercase makes indistinguishable from the fruit.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stemming or lemmatization.** Similar case-folding, stemming and lemmatization also reduces sparsity, but here by reducing inflectional forms to a base form (e.g., *\"houses\"*$\\rightarrow$*\"house\"*, *\"went\"*$\\rightarrow$*\"go\"*, *\"faster\"*$\\rightarrow$*\"fast\"*), which can help when the focus is on capturing general semantic relationships rather than fine-grained grammatical nuances. However, this also removes morphological information that might be useful, especially in morphologically rich languages or tasks where verb tense and number matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stopword removal.** Removing high-frequency, low-information words such as determiners, conjunctions, or prepositions can sometimes help downstream tasks but is often discouraged for embedding training. Word2Vec relies on natural co-occurrence statistics, and removing stopwords can distort sentence structure and eliminate valuable syntactic signals &mdash; so many practitioners keep them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cross-sentence context.** When determining the context of a (center) word, you can decide whether to consider only words within sentence boundaries or across them. Limiting training to within-sentence contexts usually produces cleaner syntactic relationships and avoids linking words that appear near each other only due to formatting or layout. But for certain tasks (e.g., document classification or discourse modeling) allowing cross-sentence windows can capture broader topical associations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summing up, preprocessing decisions depend heavily on the dataset's characteristics (formal vs. informal, domain-specific vocabulary, noise level) and the downstream task (semantic similarity, classification, named entity tasks, etc.). The key is to balance reducing noise and sparsity while preserving the linguistic signals that are meaningful for your application."

    "### Choice of Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important hyperparameters when training Word2Vec embeddings is the **context window size** $m$, which determines how many words before and after a target word are used during training. The window size directly controls what type of semantic information the model captures:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Smaller windows** (e.g., $2\\!-\\!5$ words) focus on very local context, emphasizing syntactic relationships such as part-of-speech patterns or short-range dependencies (e.g., \"*eat* $\\rightarrow$ *food*\", \"*run* $\\rightarrow$ *quickly*\"). These windows encourage embeddings that encode functional similarity.\n",
    "* **Larger windows** (e.g., $8\\!-\\!15$ words) capture broader topical or semantic relationships, yielding embeddings where words appearing in the same theme or discourse (e.g., *\"hospital\"*, *\"doctor\"*, and *\"treatment\"*) cluster together even if they do not co-occur closely.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, context size balances fine-grained syntactic information versus coarse semantic associations. In practice, common window sizes range from $2$ to $5$ for syntax-sensitive tasks to $5$ to $10$ (or even $15$) for semantic similarity or topic-related tasks. The typical default in many implementations (including the original Word2Vec code) is around $5$. While both CBOW and Skip-gram use window size in similar ways, there are subtle practical differences: CBOW tends to perform well with slightly larger windows because it aggregates multiple context words to predict the target, making it robust to noisier or broader contexts. Skip-gram, which predicts each context word individually, often benefits from smaller or moderate windows, as large windows dramatically increase the number of training pairs and may introduce more noise. Ultimately, choosing the right window size depends on the task: narrow windows for syntactic tasks, wider windows for semantic or domain-specific concept learning."

    "In the case Skip-gram with Negative Sampling (SGNS), there is also **number of negative samples** as a hyperparameter. It controls how strongly the model learns to distinguish true word-context pairs from randomly sampled, \"incorrect\" ones. Each negative sample forces the model to push apart embeddings of words that do *not* co-occur, so using more negative samples generally sharpens the model's ability to separate meaningful relationships from noise. With **too few negative samples**, the model may not learn enough contrast, leading to weaker or blurrier embeddings. With **too many**, training becomes slower and may overemphasize rejecting unlikely contexts, which can add noise or reduce the subtlety of learned semantic relations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the optimal number of negative samples depends on corpus size and vocabulary frequency distribution, but typical values are small. Mikolov et al. (the original Word2Vec authors) recommend $5$ to $20$ negative samples per positive pair, with $5$ to $10$ being common defaults. For large datasets, even fewer negatives (e.g., $2$ to $5$) often work well because the sheer volume of training examples compensates for the smaller contrast signal. Conversely, for smaller or noisier datasets, using more negative samples can help stabilize training and improve embedding quality. Overall, the number of negatives balances computational cost and the strength of the contrastive signal, and modest values tend to perform well across a wide range of tasks."

This is a concrete case showcasing that the Distributional Hypothesis does not capture all possible facets of a word's meaning. Here it clearly indicates that it is unable to capture words' polarity. Such insights are important, for example, when training models for sentiment classification based on pretrained Word2Vec word embeddings."

    "Word2Vec and similar early embedding methods learn **one fixed vector per word**, regardless of how many meanings or grammatical roles that word may have. This means that polysemous words such as *\"bank\"*, *\"apple\"*, or *\"run\"* are forced into a single representation even though they appear in very different contexts. As a result, the embedding becomes an average of all the word's usages, blending together meanings that should ideally be kept separate. This averaging can blur distinctions and reduce the usefulness of the embeddings for tasks that rely on precise semantic understanding. To give an example, consider the following sentence:"

    "Just by looking at the three occurrences of the word *\"light\"*, we can see the issue that arises when encoding the same word using the same embedding vector. For one, all three occurrences of *\"light\"* serve a different syntactic function: first an adjective, then a noun, and lastly a verb. But even even with respect to the same syntactic function, the same word may have (very) different meanings. For example, a *traffic light* is arguably a very different thing compared to a *torch light* &mdash; or just the noun *\"light\"* in a sentence like *\"I saw the light at the end of the tunnel\"*. In short, using the same embedding vector for *\"light\"* fails to capture the word's syntactic function and proper meaning. This is where attention comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a clear limitation because many downstream NLP applications (e.g., word sense disambiguation, semantic search, parsing, or contextual language understanding) require distinguishing between different senses or functions of the same word. A static embedding cannot adapt to context: the same vector is used whether *\"bank\"* refers to a financial institution or the side of a river. This restricts the model's ability to represent nuances and can lead to poorer performance compared to modern contextual embeddings (e.g., from BERT or GPT), which dynamically adjust word representations based on surrounding text."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduced the Word2Vec family of models, focusing on its three main variants: **Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW)**, **Skip-gram**, and **Skip-gram with Negative Sampling (SGNS)**. CBOW predicts a target word based on its surrounding context, making it computationally efficient and effective for large datasets. Skip-gram does the reverse, predicting context words from a target word, which is particularly useful for capturing rare words. SGNS refines Skip-gram by replacing the expensive full softmax with negative sampling, dramatically improving training speed while preserving high-quality embeddings. Together, these models form the foundation of early dense word vector representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A central insight of Word2Vec is that the learned embeddings encode meaningful geometric structure. Words with similar meanings cluster together, and specific linguistic relationships correspond to approximately linear subspaces within the vector space. Classic examples include analogies like $king – man + woman \\approx queen$, reflecting how the model captures semantic and syntactic patterns purely from co-occurrence statistics. These properties made Word2Vec a breakthrough for many NLP tasks and helped shift the field toward distributed representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook also discussed several **practical considerations** when training Word2Vec. Hyperparameters such as context window size, vector dimensionality, and the number of negative samples strongly influence the type of relationships the model captures. Preprocessing choices, including tokenization, case-folding, stopword handling, or stemming, shape what counts as a “word” and how often it appears. Dataset selection is equally important: embeddings trained on general-purpose corpora behave differently from those trained on specialized domains. Understanding these factors is essential to produce robust, meaningful word vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its strengths, Word2Vec comes with notable **limitations**. The model assigns a **single static vector** to each word type, even though many words are polysemous or function differently depending on context. This inability to represent meaning dynamically can blur important distinctions and limit performance in applications requiring fine-grained semantic understanding. Additionally, Word2Vec cannot naturally handle out-of-vocabulary words and struggles with morphological variability unless paired with subword models.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, static embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText have largely been superseded by **contextual embeddings** from modern transformer-based models such as BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT. These newer models generate representations that adapt to each occurrence of a word, capturing its meaning in context and handling polysemy, syntax, and morphology far more effectively. Word2Vec remains historically important and conceptually elegant, but dynamic embeddings have become the dominant paradigm in contemporary NLP."
