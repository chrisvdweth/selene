    "# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) &mdash; A (Very) Basic Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a powerful technique that enhances the capabilities of language models by grounding their responses in external, context-specific knowledge. Instead of relying solely on the model's internal parameters, a RAG pipeline retrieves relevant information from a curated dataset and feeds it to the model at generation time. This notebook provides a gentle, hands-on introduction to the core ideas behind RAG, using a very small example that highlights the essential components without the complexity of large-scale production systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will work with a **lightweight, locally-running pretrained LLM** and a small dataset of **news articles** that serves as our knowledge repository. By keeping both the model and the dataset intentionally small, we can focus on understanding the mechanics of retrieval, the structure of the pipeline, and how the retrieved context influences the final model output. This makes it easier to experiment, visualize, and reason about what is happening at each stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the notebook, we will build each part of the pipeline step-by-step: preprocessing the data, creating vector embeddings, storing them in a simple index, retrieving the most relevant passages based on a user query, and finally passing this context to the LLM to produce an augmented answer. Along the way, we will explain the purpose and logic behind each stage, ensuring you gain a clear conceptual understanding of how RAG systems work.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you should have a functional minimal RAG implementation that you can run on your own machine, as well as the foundational knowledge needed to scale the approach to larger models, datasets, and more advanced architectures. This small demonstration serves as a stepping stone toward designing robust retrieval-enhanced AI applications."

    "## Quick Recap: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is an approach that enhances LLM outputs by incorporating information retrieved from an external knowledge source. Instead of relying solely on what the model has learned during training &mdash; which may be incomplete, outdated, or too general &mdash; RAG dynamically fetches relevant documents, passages, or facts at query time. This makes the model's responses more grounded, accurate, and context-aware, especially in domains such as news, technical documentation, customer support, or any setting where up-to-date or specialized information is crucial. RAG can significantly reduce hallucinations, improve factuality, and enable smaller models to perform competitively by leveraging external knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic RAG pipeline operates through three core steps as shown in the figure below. In the **retrieval step**, the system takes the user's query and uses it to find similar/related/relevant document chunks from a knowledge repository. In the **augmentation step**, the retrieved (and potentially ranked, filtered, etc.) chunks are combined with the original query to form an enriched prompt. This augmented input provides the LLM with external, context-specific information that it did not necessarily learn during training. Finally, in the **generation step**, the LLM processes this combined input and produces an answer grounded in the retrieved content. Because the model has access to relevant evidence, the output is generally more accurate, detailed, and less prone to hallucination than a standard model-only response."

More specifically, we will be using `TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0`, a compact, instruction-tuned language model designed to offer strong conversational and reasoning capabilities at a fraction of the size of mainstream LLMs. With only 1.1 billion parameters, it is lightweight enough to run efficiently on standard CPUs or modest GPUs, making it easy to embed in small applications, notebooks, or teaching examples. Despite its small footprint, TinyLlama is trained on high-quality conversational and general-purpose data, allowing it to deliver coherent responses and follow instructions reliably.\n",

    "For our simple RAG setup, the model's small size ensures fast inference while still being expressive enough to clearly demonstrate how retrieved context influences generation. More importantly, however, according to its [page](https://huggingface.co/TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0) in Hugging Face, the model has been trained starting from Sep 1, 2023, for 90 days. This means that the training does not include any data available from 2024 onwards. We can therefore be sure that the model does not know the answer for any questions about more recent topics. This would be different if we would use a Cloud-based API to access an LLM which might search the Internet for an answer \"on the fly\".\n",

By calling `AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained()`, the library inspects the model metadata and returns an instance optimized for next-token prediction &mdash; ideal for text generation, chatbots, and RAG pipelines. Common arguments such as `device_map=\"auto\"` allow Transformers to automatically distribute the model across available hardware (e.g., CPU, GPU, or multiple GPUs), while `dtype=\"auto\"` selects the most efficient and compatible precision (such as float16 or bfloat16) supported by your device.

By assigning the `pad_token` to be the same as the `eos_token`, we give the model a safe, semantically neutral token that it already understands, avoiding errors or undefined behavior. This ensures that padding does not introduce unknown tokens, keeps batch processing stable, and maintains compatibility with the model's vocabulary and training setup."

The tokenizer's `apply_chat_template()` method automatically formats a list of chat messages into the exact prompt structure the model expects such as adding role tokens, separators, and special formatting that mirrors its training data. Without applying this template, the model would receive raw text without the conversational cues it relies on, leading to inconsistent or low-quality responses. \n",
    "\n",
    "**(2) Generation of output tokens.** The `apply_chat_template()` method not only formats the input, also also tokenizes the final prompt and converts each token to its corresponding token id or token index. The resulting sequence of token ids can now serve a valid input for the LLM to generate its response, which again is a sequence of token ids.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(3) Decoding of generated tokens.** To return the response as a human-readable text, we use the tokenizer's `decode()` method to convert the token ids of the response back into tokens (i.e., mainly words). Lastly, We can ignore the text before the `<|assistant|>` tag in the model's response because everything before that tag is simply the model echoing the chat template or reconstructing the conversation context—not the actual generated answer. Since the portion before `<|assistant|>` is just the model repeating the prompt or template, it does not contain meaningful output; only the text after `<|assistant|>` represents the actual assistant-generated answer."

For one, `max_length=100` limits the number of generated tokens to `100` simply to ensure that each response will not take too long to generate. By setting `temperature=0.01`, which is generally considered **small temperature** the model will produce more deterministic and conservative responses. Temperature controls how much randomness is introduced into the sampling process: lower values (close to 0) make the model favor the most probable next tokens, leading to precise, predictable, and often more factual answers.

    "### Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall, the knowledge repository for RAG systems typically does not store and index complete documents, but instead first splits documents into chunks which then are stored and indexed. This has several practical and performance-related reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Improved retrieval accuracy.** Long documents often contain many unrelated topics, so retrieving an entire document increases the chance that irrelevant or noisy text will be fed into the LLM. Smaller, semantically coherent chunks allow the retriever to match queries to *just the most relevant portions*, leading to more precise grounding and reducing hallucinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Boost retrieval efficiency**. Vector databases work best when embeddings represent focused ideas. Embedding an entire long document dilutes meaning and harms similarity scoring, while embedding short sections produces more meaningful vectors. Chunking also allows the system to retrieve only the necessary fragments, saving computation and bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Better generation quality**. LLMs have context-window limits, so feeding in an entire document wastes space and may exceed model capacity. Well-sized chunks ensure that retrieved information fits comfortably into the prompt while still providing useful detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the news articles are not very long, we probably do not really need to split them into chunks. However, since our focus is to cover the main components and steps of a RAG pipeline, we do chunk the news articles. In practical RAG systems, the quality of retrieval often depends on how well documents are broken into meaningful chunks. Many existing libraries (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex, and Haystack) provide a variety of advanced chunking strategies, including semantic splitting, recursive character splitting, and token-aware chunking &mdash; a full exploration is beyond the scape of this notebook. These tools help automate the process and are optimized for real-world workloads, where large corpora and complex document structures benefit from sophisticated preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for the purpose of this notebook, the goal is clarity and foundational understanding rather than using full-featured frameworks. Therefore, we implement a simple manual chunking approach to demonstrate the core idea in the most transparent way possible. By crafting the chunking \"by hand\", you can clearly observe how documents are segmented, how embeddings are generated for each chunk, and how retrieval operates over this structure, thus offering an intuitive grasp of the mechanics behind more advanced RAG pipelines."

Then, iterating through all paragraphs, we combine paragraphs into a chunk as long as the length of the chunk in terms of tokens is below a specified threshold. Of course, we also want to make sure the splitting only happens between two chunks and never within a chunk. The figure below illustrates this idea, where an article is split into $3$ chunks and no chunk length exceeds the maximum length limit."

    "### Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "To make use of the chunk, we not only have to store them but also make them searchable so that the retriever can effectively and efficiently find the most relevant chunks given a user's questions. There are two common approaches for indexing chunks in RAG systems, **full-text search** or **vector search**, each offering different strengths depending on the use case. **Full-text search** relies on keyword or term-based matching, using techniques such as inverted indexes, tokenization, and ranking algorithms like BM25. Its main advantages are speed, transparency, and precision for queries with clearly matching vocabulary. It also works very well on structured or technical text where keywords are stable and predictable. However, its biggest limitation is that it struggles with semantic similarity: if the user's query uses different wording or phrasing than the original text, full-text search may fail to retrieve relevant chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vector search**, on the other hand, embeds chunks and queries into dense numerical vectors and retrieves results based on semantic similarity rather than exact keyword overlap. This allows it to capture deeper meaning, making it robust to paraphrasing, synonyms, and concept-level queries. As a trade-off, vector search is more computationally expensive, requires embedding models, and may return semantically “close” but not necessarily precise or factual matches. In practice, many RAG systems combine both approaches (often called **hybrid search**) to achieve both precise keyword matching and strong semantic recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our practical example here, we will be using the vector search approach to benefit from semantic similarity search. However, this means that we need a model to embed chunks and queries into meaningful embedding vectors. Luckily, many pretrained models for this task exist and are publicly available. Our embedding model of choice in this notebook is `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, a lightweight, high-performance sentence-embedding model from the SentenceTransformers family. It is based on a distilled version of Microsoft's MiniLM architecture and produces 384-dimensional embeddings optimized for semantic similarity, clustering, and information retrieval tasks. Despite being small and fast, it delivers strong performance across a wide range of benchmarks, making it one of the most popular embedding models for RAG systems and semantic search."

    "To store and index the vectors for searching, we are using [**FAISS** (Facebook AI Similarity Search)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), an open-source library developed by Meta AI for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It is widely used in RAG systems, recommendation engines, and large-scale vector databases because it can store millions to billions of embeddings and retrieve the nearest neighbors extremely fast. FAISS provides both exact and approximate search algorithms and supports CPU and GPU acceleration, making it suitable for high-performance applications. The benefits of FAISS include **speed**, **scalability**, and **flexibility**: it handles massive datasets efficiently, offers GPU acceleration, and provides multiple indexing strategies to balance accuracy and performance. It is one of the most widely used tools for vector search in production-grade RAG pipelines.\n",

    "The code cell below performs all the required steps:\n",

    "* **Encoding of chunks.** First we convert all chunks (more specifically, the text of each chunk) into its vector representation by encoding the chunk using the pretrained `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embedding model. Since our collection of chunks is very small, we can do this for all chunks at once to get a list of embedding vectors. Notice that we set `normalize_embedding=True` in the `encode()` method,\n",
    "to L2-normalize all embedding vectors (see reason below).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Storing and indexing embedding vectors with FAISS.** FAISS supports different indexing strategies. Here, we are using the `IndexFlatIP` to perform exact nearest-neighbor search using Inner Product (IP) as the similarity metric. \"Flat\" means the index stores all vectors directly without compression or hierarchical structures, so the search is exhaustive but still highly optimized in C++. Inner Product search is commonly used when embeddings are L2-normalized, because maximizing the inner product becomes equivalent to maximizing cosine similarity. For this reason, IndexFlatIP is popular in RAG systems and semantic search setups where normalized vectors make similarity comparisons more meaningful. Its advantages include simplicity, high accuracy (since it performs exact search), and strong performance for small‐to-medium-sized embedding collections. The trade-off is that it does not scale as efficiently as FAISS’s approximate indexes when working with very large datasets (e.g., hundreds of millions of vectors).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Store metadata.** FAISS only supports storing and indexing embedding vectors but not any accompanying metadata. We therefore keep all metadata in a separate Python dictionary using the chunk ids as the keys for quick access."

The numerical range of cosine similarity or inner product depends on factors such as the embedding model, vector normalization, and the dimensionality of embeddings. A score that indicates a strong semantic match in one context might be weak in another, making it difficult to choose a single threshold that reliably separates relevant from irrelevant chunks across all queries. \n",

Some queries are very specific, making even moderate similarity scores meaningful, while others are broad, where only very high similarity scores indicate true relevance.

As a result, practitioners often experiment with thresholds empirically, adjust them dynamically based on query characteristics, or rely on ranking and top-*k* strategies combined with thresholds to balance recall and precision. These considerations, although very important in practice, go beyond the scope of this introductory notebook."

    "The RAG pipeline we implemented and showcased in this notebook, using a small example dataset, represents the most basic RAG implementation since the focus here was in simplicity and clarity. Building effective and efficient RAG pipelines for real-world application is much more challenging. While the three main steps of retrieval, augmentation, and generation still form the backbone, their implementation requires more careful considerations. In the following, we briefly outline some of the potentially added complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Advanced chunking strategies.** Our dataset of news articles was very well-behaved in a sense that documents were simply a list of (typically short) paragraphs. In real-world RAG systems, documents often have complex structures that go beyond simple continuous text. Articles, reports, or technical manuals may include tables, bullet points, code snippets, or even conversational transcripts. If these documents are naively split, chunks may cut across logical boundaries, separating related information or combining unrelated pieces. To handle such complexity, more advanced chunking strategies are often required. Semantic or structure-aware chunking can detect natural boundaries such as table rows, bullet points, or dialogue turns, ensuring each chunk represents a coherent concept. Recursive or hierarchical splitting approaches can preserve context in long documents while maintaining manageable chunk sizes for embedding.\n",

    "* **Multimodal content.** Instead of just text content &mdash; like used here in this notebook &mdash; documents for RAG systems may be multimodal, containing not only text but also images, charts, diagrams, or other visual elements. These non-textual components often carry critical information that cannot be captured through text embeddings alone. Ignoring these elements can lead to incomplete or misleading context being provided to the language model, reducing the quality and accuracy of generated responses. Incorporating multimodal content affects the implementation of a RAG pipeline in several ways. First, it requires additional preprocessing steps, such as extracting image features using computer vision models or converting charts into structured data representations. Second, embeddings must be generated for both textual and visual content, and retrieval mechanisms must be able to handle these heterogeneous embeddings in a coherent way. Finally, the augmentation step must integrate multimodal information effectively, ensuring that the language model can reason over text and visual evidence simultaneously. This adds complexity to the pipeline but is essential for building RAG systems that can leverage the full richness of modern documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Vector search vs. full text-search.** In this notebook, we considered vector search to support the semantic retrieval of chunks. While vector search is powerful for capturing semantic similarity, it can sometimes introduce challenges in RAG systems. One issue is that embeddings may retrieve chunks that are semantically related but factually incorrect or only loosely relevant to the query. For example, two concepts might be contextually similar in embedding space but differ in critical details, leading the language model to hallucinate or provide misleading answers. Additionally, vector search performance and relevance depend heavily on the quality of the embedding model and the choice of similarity metric, which may not generalize well across all queries or domains. In cases where exact keyword matches or precise terminology are important, a full-text search or a hybrid approach may be preferable. Full-text search excels at retrieving documents containing specific terms, numbers, or named entities, which is crucial in technical, legal, or scientific texts. Hybrid approaches combine the strengths of both vector and keyword-based search, first narrowing candidates using keywords and then ranking them semantically. This ensures both precision and semantic relevance, reducing the risk of retrieving irrelevant or misleading chunks while still benefiting from the flexibility of vector-based similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scaling & efficiency.** Since we used only a small pretrained model and a very small dataset, performance was not a concern for our basic RAG pipeline. Building an efficient RAG pipeline at large scale, with millions of documents, introduces several significant challenges. Firstly, storage and retrieval efficiency becomes critical, as embedding millions of chunks can require hundreds of gigabytes of memory or disk space. Simple in-memory indexes may no longer be feasible, and even vector search algorithms can become computationally expensive if not optimized. Efficient indexing structures, approximate nearest-neighbor search, and distributed storage solutions are often necessary to keep latency low while maintaining acceptable retrieval quality. And secondly, updating and maintaining the knowledge repository becomes more complex at scale. Adding new documents, reindexing embeddings, and ensuring consistency across distributed systems can be time-consuming and error-prone. Additionally, managing retrieval quality across diverse document types and domains is harder, since embeddings and chunking strategies may vary in effectiveness. Large-scale systems also need to balance precision, recall, and latency, often requiring hybrid search, caching, and prioritization strategies to ensure the RAG pipeline remains practical and responsive in real-world applications."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook provided a **practical introduction to building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** using a locally running pretrained language model and a small dataset of news articles. The goal was to illustrate the fundamental components of a RAG pipeline, including document chunking, embedding generation, vector storage and retrieval using FAISS, and augmentation of the query with retrieved information for grounded text generation. By walking through each step with simplified, \"by-hand\" implementations, the notebook made the inner workings of RAG systems transparent and accessible for educational purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook demonstrated **how to break documents into chunks** to improve retrieval relevance, encode each chunk into vector embeddings using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model, and store these embeddings in a FAISS index. It showed how retrieval works by finding the most semantically similar chunks for a given query and how these retrieved chunks are then **augmented with the user query** to provide context for the language model. This simple example highlights the interplay between retrieval and generation, which is the key insight behind RAG: the model no longer relies solely on its parametric memory but can access external, up-to-date information.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this notebook focused on clarity and simplicity, it is important to note that **real-world RAG systems involve many additional considerations**. These include handling very large datasets, ensuring efficient and scalable indexing, dealing with memory and latency constraints, dynamically selecting relevant chunks, and managing information freshness. Other practical concerns, such as multi-modal data, hybrid retrieval strategies combining vector and keyword search, and safety or guardrails to reduce hallucinations, were deliberately left out to keep the example understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the notebook served as a **hands-on educational tool** to explore the mechanics of RAG without the complexity of production-scale implementations. By implementing each step manually, you can develop a stronger intuition about how retrieval, augmentation, and generation interact and why each component matters. This foundational understanding is essential for anyone aiming to build more advanced or production-ready RAG systems in the future."
