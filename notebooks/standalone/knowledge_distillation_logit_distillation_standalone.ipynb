    "# Logit Distillation\n",
    "\n",
    "Logit distillation is a form of **transfer learning** in which a smaller or simpler *student* model learns to imitate a larger and more capable *teacher* model by training directly on the teacher's **logits**, i.e., the raw, pre-softmax outputs. Although logit distillation can be applied to virtually all kinds of machine learning models, it has become especially popular for **efficiently and effectively training small large-language models (LLMs)**. Modern LLMs are extremely large and expensive to train from scratch, but with logit distillation, a small student can inherit much of the linguistic competence, reasoning ability, and output structure of a large teacher at a fraction of the compute cost. This has made distillation a core technique behind many \"compact\" LLMs that provide strong performance while running on modest hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of **logit distillation** is to train the student not only to predict correct labels but also to replicate the soft output distribution of the teacher. The teacher's logits reveal which alternative outputs are plausible and by how much. This kind of information is completely lost when using one-hot labels. During training, the student minimizes a combination of standard cross-entropy with ground-truth labels and a distillation loss (often KL divergence) comparing its logits to the teacher's logits. A temperature parameter is commonly applied to soften the distributions, making the teacher's knowledge easier to mimic. By learning from these richer signals, the student model can approximate the teacher’s function more faithfully than it could by relying on hard labels alone. This often results in better generalization, smoother decision boundaries, and significantly improved performance for small models, especially in natural language tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook begins by introducing logit distillation on a **conceptual level**, explaining how a smaller student model can learn from the raw output logits of a larger teacher model. We will briefly discuss why logits provide a richer learning signal than hard labels, how this approach fits into the broader family of transfer-learning techniques, and why it has become especially important for training efficient yet capable small LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "After building this conceptual foundation, the notebook will walk through a **complete hands-on example** using PyTorch. We will load a pretrained large language model as the teacher, set up a smaller model as the student, and implement the full distillation workflow—including generating teacher logits, computing the distillation loss, and optimizing the student model. By the end, you’ll have a clear understanding of both the theory and the practical code involved in performing logit distillation for LLMs."

    "## Logit Distillation Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "Many modern machine learning models &mdash; especially large neural networks and LLMs &mdash; are often **over-parameterized**. This over-parameterization is useful during training because it helps models fit complex patterns, explore large hypothesis spaces, and achieve strong generalization. However, once trained, these large models are often **far more complex than necessary** for the specific task or dataset they need to perform on (e.g., a customer chatbot for a banking application). In many practical applications, a smaller model could produce comparable outputs at a fraction of the computational cost, memory footprint, and latency. Despite this, training even a compact model *from scratch* still requires substantial compute, large datasets, and long training times.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, we already have much larger foundation models that \"know\" language. So why not utilize this knowledge? This is where **knowledge distillation** becomes valuable. Instead of training a small model independently, distillation allows it to learn directly from an already-trained larger model. By imitating the behavior of the large model the smaller model can inherit much of the teacher's competence without needing the full training pipeline or dataset scale. This dramatically reduces the resources required to produce a high-performing small model, while preserving much of the accuracy and generalization power of the original. As a result, knowledge distillation has become a key strategy for deploying efficient and capable models, particularly in environments where compute, memory, or latency are constrained."

    "\n",
    "The figure below illustrates on a very high level the basic idea of knowledge distillation in the context of LLMs: take a large pretrained model which performs very well, and transfer or \"distill\" its knowledge into a (much smaller) model. The \"knowledge\" that gets transferred is not literal facts or memorized data, but the teacher model's *behavior* &mdash, that is, its soft probability distributions, reasoning tendencies, and implicit structure of language &mdash; rather than explicit facts. These **soft targets** or **soft labels** reveal which alternatives are plausible, how confident the teacher is, and how it organizes semantic and syntactic relationships. By training on the teacher's outputs, the student picks up the teacher's inductive biases, heuristics, and task-specific patterns, allowing it to imitate the teacher’s style of reasoning and decision-making even with far fewer parameters."

    "Knowledge distillation is not a single method but a general concept, and different ways to implement this concept exist. While practical implementation are often hybrid and can differ in many important or subtle details, knowledge distillation can broadly be categorized into three approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Response distillation** uses a teacher model to automatically generate annotations for an **unlabeled dataset**, allowing the student model to be trained without manual labeling, for example, by having the teacher LLM answer questions that form the training data. It is easy to implement, works in a black-box fashion through APIs, and generally yields high-quality labels if the teacher is strong. However, generating large numbers of annotations can be costly, teacher outputs lack the nuanced information found in logits (making the student less creative or flexible), and the method cannot produce accurate labels for highly domain-specific data the teacher was never trained on. In short, we simple use the teacher model to annotate and unlabeled dataset to train the student model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Logit distillation** &mdash; the focus of this notebook &mdash; trains the student model to mimic the teacher model by comparing their logits rather than final text responses, which makes the method both more informative and easier to optimize. In principle, this can be done without labeled data by minimizing a distillation loss (e.g., KL divergence) between teacher and student logits, though this makes evaluation difficult and heavily depends on teacher quality. When ground-truth labels are available, logits distillation can be combined with the standard student loss, offering more stable training and easier evaluation but adding complexity due to the need to balance both losses and manage potential conflicts when the teacher's predictions diverge from the labeled data, especially for examples outside the teacher's training distribution. As long as it is possible to logits as the output from the teacher, logit distillation is still a black-box approach like response distillation\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Feature distillation** extends beyond matching the teacher's outputs by training the student to replicate the teacher's internal representations, providing a deeper and richer supervision signal often used alongside logit distillation. However, this approach adds significant complexity because the student is typically much smaller, making it nontrivial to align layers or activations between the two models; for example, a student with fewer or narrower Transformer layers must be mapped to corresponding teacher layers, often requiring strategies like layer selection, learnable projections, or feature pooling to compute a meaningful feature-level loss. Of course, since we now need access to outputs of internal layers, feature distillation inherently assumes white-box access to the teacher model's architecture and parameters."

    "#### KLD vs MSE Loss: Pros & Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "Having these to alternatives of computing the soft loss between the teacher and student logits, the obvious question is which to choose in practice. The key difference between using KL divergence and MSE lies in what each loss function actually compares. KL divergence operates on **probability distributions**, meaning both teacher and student logits must first be passed through a softmax (typically with temperature scaling). As a result, KL-based distillation encourages the student to match the *relative probability structure* of the teacher, i.e., how the teacher distributes confidence across all tokens. In contrast, MSE operates directly on the **raw logits**, without converting them into probabilities. This means MSE encourages the student to regress toward the teacher's raw score values, preserving fine-grained differences that softmax may obscure.\n",
    "\n",
    "KL divergence has the advantage of being theoretically grounded in information theory: it measures how much information is lost when the student approximates the teacher's probability distribution. Because it focuses on relative logit differences rather than absolute values, KL distillation is often more aligned with the ultimate behavior of autoregressive language models, which make decisions through softmax outputs. However, KL divergence can be sensitive to the temperature hyperparameter, and without proper tuning, gradients can vanish when the teacher's distribution becomes very peaked. It can also be computationally more expensive, since softmax operations must be applied at each training step.\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE on logits, on the other hand, is simpler and often more stable in practice. Since it avoids the softmax, it reduces numerical complexity and eliminates the need for temperature tuning. This can make training faster and easier to debug. Additionally, because logits carry richer information than probabilities, especially about low-probability classes, MSE can transfer subtle teacher knowledge that the softmax would otherwise compress. However, MSE treats all logit dimensions equally, even though in a language model only the *relative* differences between logits matter for prediction; absolute logit scales may therefore mislead the student unless the teacher's logits are well-behaved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the choice between KL divergence and MSE depends on the goal and the characteristics of the models involved. If you want the student to closely match the teacher's decision distribution (and are willing to tune temperatures) KL divergence is often the more principled choice. If you prefer a simpler, more direct, and sometimes more stable regression signal, especially early in training or with limited compute, MSE on logits can be an excellent alternative. Both approaches can yield strong results, and many distillation setups combine them with additional losses to balance their strengths. For example, the paper [*\"Comparing Kullback-Leibler Divergence and Mean Squared Error Loss in Knowledge Distillation\"*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08919) compares the loss function shows that MSE often performs better. However, the evaluation was done in the context of an image classification task, and it is not obvious how these results translate to LLMs."

It contains 50,000 labeled movie reviews** from IMDb, evenly split into 25,000 for training and 25,000 for testing, with an equal number of positive and negative reviews in each split. In addition to the labeled reviews, the dataset includes 50,000 unlabeled reviews, intended to support semi-supervised learning experiments. For training the student model, we do not need the sentiment labels but only the review texts. We therefore already preprocessed the original dataset such that all 100,000 reviews are in a single file, with 1 line = 1 review. This preprocessing included the removal of any HTML tags and line breaks.\n",

During training, chunks are drawn such that the model learns from natural text continuity while still being able to infer when one document ends and the next begins. This method helps maintain statistical consistency, supports scalable data pipelines, and aligns with how modern language models (e.g., GPT-style models) are typically trained on web-scale corpora.

Instead, the model must read the data as a continuous stream from disk or distributed storage, which introduces issues such as maintaining efficient throughput, handling document boundaries, and ensuring sufficient randomness without full in-memory shuffling. These constraints force the design of specialized data pipelines that can deliver tokens sequentially while still providing the statistical diversity required for effective language-model training. However, in this notebook, we can ignore these considerations since our dataset is small and fits into memory, making its handling much simpler."

    "Modern LLMs are trained on documents tokenized with **subword tokenizers** because these tokenization methods provide a flexible balance between character-level and word-level representations. Natural language contains an enormous vocabulary with many rare words, inflections, and spelling variations that are difficult to model using pure word-level tokenization, which would require an impractically large vocabulary and produce many out-of-vocabulary tokens. Subword tokenizers (e.g. BPE, WordPiece, and SentencePiece) break words into smaller, reusable units, allowing the model to represent any text as a sequence of known symbols while still capturing meaningful linguistic structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of subword tokenization are substantial: it dramatically reduces vocabulary size, ensures coverage of all possible text inputs, and allows the model to share statistical strength across related words through common subword components. This leads to more efficient training, improved generalization to unseen words, and better handling of multilingual or noisy data. By limiting the vocabulary while preserving expressiveness, subword tokenizers enable LLMs to scale to massive corpora without exploding memory requirements or losing linguistic nuance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our teacher model is GPT-2, we also need to use the **corresponding pretrained GPT-2 tokenizer** because the model was trained on text that was tokenized in a very specific way. The tokenizer defines the mapping from raw text to token IDs, including how words are split into subwords, special tokens used, and the exact vocabulary. If a different tokenizer were used, the input IDs would not match the representations the model expects, leading to incorrect embeddings and poor or nonsensical outputs. Essentially, the tokenizer and model must be aligned to ensure that the model interprets text in the same way it saw during pretraining. The GPT-2 tokenizer uses Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) and has a vocabulary size of $50,257$.\n",

The `from_pretrained` method is used to load a tokenizer that has already been trained on a specific model's vocabulary and tokenization rules, either from the Hugging Face model hub or a local path.

The `DataLoader` class then builds on top of this by handling the efficient batching, shuffling, and parallel loading of data samples from a `Dataset`. It automatically groups multiple samples into mini-batches and can use multiple worker processes to load data in parallel, ensuring that the GPU remains fully utilized during training.\n",

Note that the dashed line represents the causal masking where the prediction of a token only depends on preceding tokens but not \"future\" tokens &mdash; recall that the decoder processes *all* tokens in parallel during training, so we need to mask the attention between a token and all tokens preceding it."

Transformer models compute attention across all token pairs within a sequence, which scales quadratically with sequence length in both memory and computation cost. This means that doubling the context size roughly quadruples the resources required per training step. To make training feasible on available hardware, a practical upper bound (e.g., 512, 1024, or 4096 tokens) is chosen so that the model can learn meaningful dependencies without exhausting GPU memory or dramatically slowing training.\n",

When training an LLM, the context size (or context window) refers to the maximum number of tokens the model can attend to at once through its self-attention mechanism. This determines how far back in the text the model can directly \"look\" when predicting the next token. For example, if the context size is $1,048$ tokens, the model can condition its predictions on at most those $1,048$ previous tokens, regardless of how long the full document is.\n",

    "In principle, the context size is not a direct hyperparameter for knowledge distillation tasks, since the **context size does not determine the size or complexity of the model** &mdash; which depends on the number of layers, the width of each layer (hidden dimension), and the number of attention heads. These architectural choices determine the total number of parameters, compute cost, and representational capacity. The context size only affects the *shape of the training data* and the *compute per forward pass* (since attention scales with sequence length), but it does not change the learned weights or the overall architecture.\n",

Unlike modern models that often use relative encodings (like RoPE or ALiBi) to generalize to longer lengths, GPT-2 was trained with a fixed lookup table (a specific weight matrix) containing exactly 1,024 unique vectors, one for each possible position in the sequence. Consequently, if you attempt to feed the model more than $1,024$ tokens, it physically lacks the trained parameters to represent the position of the $1,025$th token, making inference impossible without truncating the input or fundamentally modifying and retraining the architecture. In short, we cannot set `context_size` to a value larger than $1,024$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* While the context size does not affect the model size, it does directly affect the memory requirements for training and inferencing because the attention mechanism scales quadratically with sequence length: for a context window of $N$ tokens, each layer computes an $N\\!\\times\\!N$ attention matrix. During training, as $N$ grows, the model must store larger intermediate representations, gradients, and attention scores, which directly increases GPU memory usage. Longer sequences also increase the amount of activation memory that must be kept for backpropagation, making training significantly more expensive even when the model architecture (number of layers, hidden size) stays the same. Inference requires less memory, but the model still computes an $N\\!\\times\\!N$ attention matrix, the memory requirements still scale quadratically.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, we set the context size to $128$ (see below), which is often considered on the lower end for training small LLMs on small datasets. That being said, if you run out of memory when training the student model using logit distillation, you can try further reducing the context size to lower the overall memory footprint."

    "The connection between the student and the teacher model during training happens through the loss function &mdash; more specifically, through the loss function computing the soft loss (see above). Since these loss functions are not part of the standard toolbox of PyTorch we have to implement them ourselves. However, the methods provided by PyTorch allow for a direct implementation of the given formulas of both alternatives. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the method `kl_div_loss()` below computes the loss using the Kubler-Leibler (KL) Divergence after applying the softmax to both the teacher and student logits. Notice that we compute the log softmax since the PyTorch method [`kl_div(p, q, ...)`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.kl_div.html) expects `p` to be log probabilities. By default, the method expects `q` to be probabilities, but by setting `log_target=True` we can pass log probabilities here as well. Lastly, the parameter `reduction=\"batchmean\"` means that the method will sum the KL divergence over all elements in each sample, then average that total over the batch size. This keeps the loss scale consistent regardless of sequence length or number of classes, making the magnitude of the loss more stable when training across different batch sizes."

At the same time, it also runs the teacher model on the same inputs to obtain its logits, which provide a softer, more informative probability distribution over next-token predictions.\n",

After calculating the blended loss, the method performs standard PyTorch backpropagation and optimizer steps to update the student model's parameters.\n",

    "#### Saving & Loading Checkpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the goal of knowledge distillation is to train smaller models, it typically still requires a lot of computing resources and training time. To avoid an loss of progress (e.g., in case of a crash), we can use checkpoints A **checkpoint** in model training is a saved snapshot of the model's state at a specific point during training, typically after a certain number of steps or epochs. It usually includes the model's parameters (weights and biases), the optimizer state (to resume learning with the same momentum and learning rate adjustments), and sometimes metadata like the current epoch or training loss. This allows training to be paused and later resumed from that point without starting over, which is especially important for large models that take days or weeks to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "While many libraries have built-in support for periodically saving checkpoints, in this notebook, we purposefully use only PyTorch and avoid libraries with a higher level of abstraction. However, saving a checkpoint is very straightforward. The method `save_checkpoint()` defined in the code cell below takes a model and optimizer instance, as well as the information about the current epoch and epoch loss. The method then combines all required information to resume training into a single object and uses the `save()` method of PyTorch to save this object to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In PyTorch, the `state_dict()` object is a Python dictionary that contains all the learnable parameters and persistent states of a model or optimizer. For models, it stores mappings from each layer's name to its corresponding tensor values (like weights and biases). For optimizers, it includes the current state of optimization variables such as momentum buffers and learning rate schedules. This dictionary enables easy saving, loading, and transferring of model and optimizer states, making it central to checkpointing and model deployment. By calling `torch.save(model.state_dict())`, you can preserve a model's learned parameters, and later restore them with `model.load_state_dict()`, ensuring the model continues exactly where it left off."

In other words, the method does not create a model or optimizer but sets the state of both instances as the states read from the checkpoint file. This of course only works if the model and the optimizer have the same \"structure\" as the model and optimizer used for training. For example, we cannot train a Transformer model with 4 layers and then load its state into a model with more or less layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, notice the `map_location` parameter of PyTorch's `load()` method. This parameter controls how tensors are remapped to devices (like CPU or GPU) when loading a saved model or checkpoint. This is useful when the model was trained on one device but needs to be loaded on another; for example, loading GPU-trained weights onto a CPU-only machine. By specifying `map_location='cpu'`, all tensors are loaded to the CPU regardless of where they were originally saved, while `map_location='cuda:0'` loads them to the first GPU. It can also take a custom function or dictionary to flexibly remap devices, ensuring model compatibility across different hardware setups and preventing errors caused by unavailable devices."

The goal here is not to push performance boundaries, but to provide a clear and practical demonstration of how logit distillation works in principle. By choosing a smaller teacher, we ensure that the entire workflow &mdash; from loading the model to generating logits and training the student &mdash; remains efficient and reproducible on common setups."

    "#### Student Model\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to the student model, we only have two main restrictions. Firstly and most obviously, the student must also be an autoregressive model to match the next-word prediction task. And secondly, the model must work with the same vocabulary. Not only must the logit output $\\mathbf{z}^t$ and $\\mathbf{z}^s$ match in size, they must also be aligned with respect to the vocabulary. This means that the $i$-th value in both $\\mathbf{z}^t$ and $\\mathbf{z}^s$ most refer to the same token. The obvious way to ensure this is to simply use the same tokenizer instance for both the teacher and student model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from that, since logit distillation only relies on both models output, the teacher and the student can \"look\" quite differently. For example, in principle the student can be an RNN-based model even when the teacher is a Transformer. Distillation does not require teacher and student architectures to match; it only requires that the student can produce outputs in the same format as the teacher so that the distillation loss can be computed. As long as the student RNN can generate logits over the same vocabulary as the Transformer teacher, it can be trained to approximate the teacher's behavior through MSE or KL divergence-based soft losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, several practical challenges arise. Transformer teachers typically produce richer contextual representations due to their self-attention mechanisms, while RNNs rely solely on sequential recurrence, which may limit the student's ability to fully mimic the teacher's long-range dependencies. This mismatch in capacity and inductive bias can make distillation less effective unless the student is adequately sized or supplemented with architectural enhancements such as attention mechanisms or gating. Despite these limitations, cross-architecture distillation such as Transformer-to-RNN remains feasible and has been successfully explored in research when efficiency or deployment constraints prioritize smaller, simpler models.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to keep it simple, we go with another GPT-2 model for the student. Note that GPT-2 only refers to the vocabulary size, the pretrained tokenizer, and general Transformer-based architecture &mdash; GPT-2 does not refer to any specific size of the model in terms of the token embedding size, the number of attention heads, the number of attention heads, and so on. By choosing a GPT-2 model we can not only use existing classes from the `transformers` library to create the model, but also our auxiliary method `generate_response()` for bot the teacher and model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define our student model, we use the [`GPT2Config`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/gpt2#transformers.GPT2Config) class of the `transformers` library. This class defines all the hyperparameters and architectural settings used to construct a GPT-2 model. Instead of hard-coding model dimensions, number of layers, attention heads, vocabulary size, and other internal parameters directly in the code, these values are encapsulated inside a configuration object. This configuration is what the model uses to determine its structure &mdash; everything from hidden size and number of transformer blocks to dropout rates, activation functions, and positional embedding settings. In the code cell below, we create a `GPT2Config` instance using only $1/3$ of the embedding size ($256$ instead of $768$), $1/3$ of the number of attention heads ($4$ instead of $12$), and $1/3$ of the number of layers ($4$ instead of $12$) compared to the teacher model (i.e., GPT-2 Small, by default)."

This design allows the model to predict the next token in a sequence, making it suitable for tasks such as text generation, completion, and autoregressive training. The class handles the forward pass, loss computation (when labels are provided), and all components needed for next-token prediction.

    "After training, you can inspect the saved `.csv` file to compare the results for differen $\\alpha$ values. Keep in mind that when training a small student LLM with logit distillation on a **small dataset**, the results can be noisy and may not clearly reveal the impact of different loss-weighting strategies (e.g., how you mix hard-label cross-entropy with soft-label distillation loss). With limited data, the student model has only a narrow view of the task distribution, so variations in balance factor $\\alpha$, temperature $\\tau$, or loss formulations may get overshadowed by sampling noise, underfitting, or simple capacity limits of the student. As a result, the trends you would normally expect to observe in larger, more realistic distillation setups may not appear or may fluctuate unpredictably."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provided a comprehensive introduction to **logit distillation**, covering both the conceptual foundations and a full, practical implementation using PyTorch and the Hugging Face `transformers` library. We began by explaining the motivation behind knowledge distillation: large models often contain far more parameters than necessary for a specific task, yet training smaller models from scratch can be costly. Logit distillation offers a streamlined alternative by teaching a compact student model to mimic the raw logits of a larger, pretrained teacher model to capture subtle information about the teacher's decision process without requiring full probability distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the conceptual side, we explored why aligning logits can be beneficial. While KL divergence-based distillation, which requires softmax conversions and temperature tuning, was originally proposed, logit distillation can also be implemented using a simple regression-style objective like MSE to directly match the teacher's pre-softmax outputs. This approach preserves fine-grained relational structure in the logits and can lead to easier optimization and reduced computational overhead. We also highlighted that logit distillation is **not specific to language models**; it is a general and widely applicable method for compressing machine learning models across domains such as vision, speech, and tabular prediction. In this notebook, however, we used the context of LLMs to provide a concrete and accessible example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The practical part of the notebook walked step-by-step through implementing logit distillation with **GPT-2 Small as the teacher model**. We showed how to prepare data, extract teacher logits efficiently, define a student model via `GPT2Config`, compute the logit-based distillation loss, and train the student using PyTorch. Each step was designed to illuminate how the different components (model architecture, forward passes, loss functions, and optimization loops) fit together in a full distillation pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we emphasized that the goal of this notebook was **not** to train a state-of-the-art model or achieve cutting-edge performance. Instead, the emphasis was on clarity, transparency, and building a deeper understanding of how logit distillation works in practice. By walking through every stage of the process, the notebook equips you with the knowledge needed to adapt and extend these techniques to your own models, whether in research, experimentation, or practical deployment."
