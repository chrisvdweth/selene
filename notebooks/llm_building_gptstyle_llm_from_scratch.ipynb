    "# Building a GPT-Style LLM from Scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to train a **GPT-style language model** from scratch using the Transformer implementation provided by PyTorch. The model is trained on a toy dataset of 100,000 movie reviews, which makes it computationally manageable while still providing meaningful insights into how Transformer-based language models learn. The primary goal of this notebook is **educational** to help you understand the core components and workflow of training a language model, rather than to build a high-performance, state-of-the-art LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook begins by preparing the movie review dataset for a **next-word prediction task**, which is the standard training objective used in autoregressive models like GPT. This process includes tokenizing the text, constructing a vocabulary, and splitting each review into overlapping input-target pairs so the model can learn to predict the next word in a sequence. Although the dataset is small, it allows the training process to be visualized and understood step by step, without the need for massive compute resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the notebook defines a **decoder-only Transformer model** by leveraging PyTorch's built-in `nn.Transformer` module. This section illustrates how to configure the Transformer to function in a GPT-like manner, including the use of **causal masking**, **sinusoidal positional encodings**, and a simple output projection layer for next-token prediction. Using the native PyTorch API simplifies the implementation, allowing the focus to remain on understanding how the model architecture, positional encodings, and attention mechanism work together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the notebook walks through the **training loop**, showing how to compute the cross-entropy loss, perform optimization steps, and periodically evaluate the model's ability to generate coherent text continuations. While the resulting model is not designed for real-world deployment, it demonstrates the fundamental process behind GPT-style LLM training in a transparent and reproducible way. Overall, this notebook serves as a **hands-on educational guide** to gain practical experience with Transformer-based language models. By using PyTorch's Transformer implementation, it balances conceptual clarity with practical simplicity, offering an accessible yet technically grounded introduction to autoregressive text modeling."

    "\n",
    "The [**ACL IMDB (Large Movie Review) dataset**](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) is a popular benchmark dataset for sentiment analysis, introduced by Andrew Maas et al. (2011). It contains a total of 100,000 movie reviews collected from IMDb, with 50,000 reviews being labeled as either *positive* or *negative* and evenly split into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. For training Word2Vec word embeddings we do not need the sentiment labels. We therefore already preprocessed the original dataset such that all 100,000 reviews are in a single file, with 1 line = 1 review. This preprocessing included the removal of any HTML tags and line breaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the training of our model, we make the common assumption that the training data is structured as continuous streams of documents, with each movie review representing a document. Document streams refer to the way text data is fed into the model during training: not as isolated documents, but as a continuous stream of text. Instead of treating each document as an independent unit, the training corpus is viewed as a long sequence of tokens coming from many documents concatenated together. This approach allows the model to learn language patterns and long-range dependencies across boundaries that would otherwise be artificially imposed by document splits. The training process still ensures that context resets appropriately between documents (e.g., by inserting special end-of-document tokens `[EOS]`), but from the model's perspective, the data flows in a seamless stream. Thus, assuming $\\text{doc}_{i}$ is a list of tokens represents the $i$-th documents, our document stream has the following format:"

    "Document streaming is essential for efficient batching and scaling when training on massive corpora. LLMs are typically trained on trillions of tokens spread across billions of documents, and it’s computationally impractical to load entire documents or reinitialize contexts for each. Instead, data pipelines tokenize all documents in advance, concatenate them, and then dynamically sample fixed-length chunks (e.g., 1024 tokens) to feed into the model. This \"streaming\" setup keeps GPUs fully utilized and allows distributed training systems to continuously stream data without needing to restart or reshuffle individual documents frequently."

    "### Tokenize & Generate Token Stream\n",
    "\n",
    "Each document (i.e., each movie review) is represented as a string. We therefore have to tokenize each review and represent each using a unique token index. In principle, we could implement both steps on our own (e.g., tokenizing using spaCy and creating a vocabulary for creating the token indices). However, to focus on the LLM training, we used the pretrained GPT-2 tokenizer to handle both the tokenization and indexing for us. The GPT-2 tokenizer is a subword tokenizer based on the **Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)** algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In nutshell, BPE (and similar approaches) learns how to tokenize words from data. Instead of splitting text strictly into full words or individual characters, BPE breaks words into frequently occurring subword units. For example, *\"unhappiness*\" might become *\"un\"*, *\"happi\"*, and *\"ness\"*. This enables the model to represent common words as single tokens while decomposing rare words into smaller, reusable pieces, preventing the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem that word-level tokenizers suffer from. Because subword tokens capture meaningful morphological patterns (prefixes, suffixes, roots), models can infer the meaning of new or compound words based on familiar subparts. This reduces the total number of parameters needed for embeddings and improves the model's ability to generalize to unseen text. You can learn all about BPE in a separate notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "To load the pretrained GPT-2 tokenizer, we can use the `AutoTokenizer` class Hugging Face Transformers library. This class is a high-level interface that automatically selects the appropriate tokenizer for a given pretrained model, abstracting away the need to know the specific tokenizer class. The `from_pretrained` method is used to load a tokenizer that has already been trained on a specific model's vocabulary and tokenization rules, either from the Hugging Face model hub or a local path. This method ensures that the tokenizer is configured consistently with the pretrained model, including token-to-ID mappings, special tokens, and any subword tokenization schemes (e.g., BPE), making it ready for encoding text into token IDs suitable for model training or inference. The code cell below used the class and method to load the GPT-2 tokenizer."

    "Of course, we cannot give the whole sequence of tokens to the model at once. When training LLMs, the **context size**, i.e., the number of tokens the model can attend to at once, is typically fixed to a maximum value due to both computational and architectural constraints. Transformer models compute attention across all token pairs within a sequence, which scales quadratically with sequence length in both memory and computation cost. This means that doubling the context size roughly quadruples the resources required per training step. To make training feasible on available hardware, a practical upper bound (e.g., 512, 1024, or 4096 tokens) is chosen so that the model can learn meaningful dependencies without exhausting GPU memory or dramatically slowing training.\n",

    "\n",
    "Training a Transformer-based LLM requires a lot of training, even for a rather small model trained using a rather small dataset. A **checkpoint** in model training is a saved snapshot of the model's state at a specific point during training, typically after a certain number of steps or epochs. It usually includes the model's parameters (weights and biases), the optimizer state (to resume learning with the same momentum and learning rate adjustments), and sometimes metadata like the current epoch or training loss. This allows training to be paused and later resumed from that point without starting over, which is especially important for large models that take days or weeks to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "While many libraries have built-in support for periodically saving checkpoints, in this notebook, we purposefully use only PyTorch and avoid libraries with a higher level of abstraction. However, saving a checkpoint is very straightforward. The method `save_checkpoint()` defined in the code cell below takes a model and optimizer instance, as well as the information about the current epoch and epoch loss. The methods the combines all required information to resume training into a single object and uses the `save()` method of PyTorch to save this object to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In PyTorch, the `state_dict()` object is a Python dictionary that contains all the learnable parameters and persistent states of a model or optimizer. For models, it stores mappings from each layer's name to its corresponding tensor values (like weights and biases). For optimizers, it includes the current state of optimization variables such as momentum buffers and learning rate schedules. This dictionary enables easy saving, loading, and transferring of model and optimizer states, making it central to checkpointing and model deployment. By calling `torch.save(model.state_dict())`, you can preserve a model's learned parameters, and later restore them with `model.load_state_dict()`, ensuring the model continues exactly where it left off."

For example, we cannot train a Transformer model with 4 layers and then load its state into a model with more or less layers.\n",

By specifying `map_location='cpu'`, all tensors are loaded to the CPU regardless of where they were originally saved, while `map_location='cuda:0'` loads them to the first GPU. It can also take a custom function or dictionary to flexibly remap devices, ensuring model compatibility across different hardware setups and preventing errors caused by unavailable devices."

Unlike the original Transformer, which uses an encoder–decoder structure for sequence-to-sequence tasks such as translation, GPT-2 discards the encoder and retains only the **decoder blocks**, each composed of self-attention and feedforward layers. Importantly, it applies a **causal masking**, ensuring that each token can only attend to earlier positions, thereby preserving the left-to-right generation order required for text prediction.

Rather than learning these positions as parameters, the paper proposed a **fixed sinusoidal encoding** scheme based on sine and cosine functions of varying frequencies. The sinusoidal formulation ensures that each position in the sequence is mapped to a unique vector, while also enabling the model to generalize to sequence lengths longer than those seen during training.

    "GPT-2, like many other popular LLMs, is a so-called decoder only model. This not only means that the model uses only the decoder of the overall architecture but also that the decoder is missing the cross-attention layer that aligns the encoder output with the decoder input. The figure below illustrates this idea by shading out all the parts of the complete Transformer architecture not being used for training a decoder-only LLM such as GPT-2."

    "To implement our model, we can directly use classes implementing the Transformer architecture provided by PyTorch. This includes the `nn.TransformerDecoder` class implementing the decoder part of the Transformer. However, the problem is that this class expects as input the output of a decoder, which we obviously do not have in our decoder-only setup. However, if you look at the figure above, notice that the decoder without the cross-attention block is the same as the encoder. Thus we can simply use the `nn.TransformerEncoder` class. We only have to keep in mind to still use a causal mask during training and inference to stop the model to \"look into the future\".\n",

    "The class `GPT2LanguageModel` below implements the complete model. Apart from the size of the vocabulary size, the input parameters of the constructor specify the different parameters of the encoder layer incl. the number of attention heads and the number of layers. The internal method `_generate_square_subsequent_mask()` precomputes that causal mask for the maximum context size (i.e., the maximum length of the input sequence). Again, since the mask contains fixed values and not trainable parameters, we use `register_buffer()` to add the mask to the model's state. Overall this class is essentially a 1:1 implementation of the figure above."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Training a GPT-style language model from scratch provides valuable insight into the **core components and workflow** that underlie modern large language models. Even when using a small, toy dataset, the process mirrors the same fundamental principles used to train state-of-the-art systems. The training begins with preparing a text corpus for **next-word prediction**, the central objective of autoregressive language models. This involves tokenizing the text, building a vocabulary, and generating input-target pairs where the model learns to predict the next token in a sequence based on the preceding ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of the model lies the **Transformer architecture**, which uses stacked layers of self-attention and feedforward networks to model long-range dependencies in text. In a GPT-style (decoder-only) setup, the Transformer employs **masked self-attention**, ensuring that predictions for a given position depend only on earlier tokens in the sequence. Positional encodings—often fixed sinusoidal functions—are added to the token embeddings to give the model a sense of order, since attention itself has no inherent notion of sequence. These design elements together enable the model to capture complex syntactic and semantic relationships between words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **training process** typically involves minimizing a cross-entropy loss that measures how well the model predicts the next token. Through repeated optimization steps, the model gradually improves its internal language representations. While a small model trained on limited data will not produce fluent or generalizable text, it still exhibits the same learning dynamics observed in much larger systems, offering a practical and interpretable context for understanding how Transformers learn.\n",

    "In practice, training competitive LLMs requires **vastly larger datasets, model sizes, and computational resources**, often spanning hundreds of billions of tokens and thousands of GPUs. However, the **overall workflow remains fundamentally the same** &mdash; from data preparation and tokenization to model design, loss computation, and iterative optimization. By experimenting with small-scale GPT models, one can grasp the essential mechanics that scale up directly to real-world LLMs, providing a solid conceptual foundation for understanding the architecture and training pipeline behind today’s leading generative models."
